      "[' manakamana doesn\\'t answer any questions, yet makes its point: nepal, like the rest of our planet, is a picturesque but far from peaceable kingdom.  wilfully offensive and powered by a chest-thumping machismo, but it\\'s good clean fun.  it would be difficult to imagine material more wrong for spade than lost & found.  despite the gusto its star brings to the role, it\\'s hard to ride shotgun on hector\\'s voyage of discovery.  if there was a good idea at the core of this film, it\\'s been buried in an unsightly pile of flatulence jokes, dog-related bad puns and a ridiculous serial arson plot.  gleeson goes the hallmark channel route, damaging an intermittently curious entry in the time travel subgenre.  it was the height of satire in 1976: dark as hell, but patently absurd and surely nowhere close to objective reality. objective reality surpassed it somewhere in the jerry springer era.  everyone in \"the comedian\" deserves a better movie than \"the comedian.\"  actor encourages grumpy christians to embrace the season.  slight, contained, but ineffably soulful.  bell\\'s debut feature addresses its subject with both humor and intelligence, approaching the issue of performance enhancement from every conceivable angle  ... except for its shamelessly (and irresistibly) zingy music score (by the director), halloween achieves its considerable power almost entirely through visual means.  this is not one for the uninitiated. it\\'s also not one for people who like action and thrills.  son of saul employs the formal mechanics of filmmaking to turn [its] ... questions back in on and around themselves, doing what cinema does best in the hands of great filmmakers: showing by not showing, telling by not telling.  it isn\\'t thrilling. fox can\\'t act. the backchat is more filthy than funny.  hiddleston and swinton are lovely to watch, but they need more to chew on than this.  yossi is a stronger film than its predecessor, more deeply felt and less reliant on love-story conventions.  i feel like a sparkle baby just puked rainbow-colored dust all over my head.   long, unfocused film.  kubo and the two strings is better than immersive -- it\\'s absorptive. we\\'re pulled in knight\\'s direction; we become part of his studio\\'s technical wizardry.  easy to enjoy, if you\\'re at all susceptible to this sort of thing, but it leaves you with nothing to think about, except for all the opportunities brooks missed to make something worthwhile out of the material.  an extraordinary blast from the past, x-men: first class will go down as one of this decade\\'s best superhero movies.  mostly lightweight, but the most interesting part of the movie is jamie foxx as electro. this villain embodies black rage, more malcolm x than mutant.  drawn, per a disclaimer, from period accounts of strange phenomena and psychotic breaks among settlers, eggers\\'s impeccably crafted, historically accurate creepshow wears its deep-dive research on its tattered gingham sleeves.  ... hones its dramatic elements to emotional effect rather than fall back on a slasher film template... moretz brings her a-game...  what seemed like a decent idea - a fourth and final stroll through the american pie gutter - is swamped by the reason why most of these actors haven\\'t worked much between sequels. they simply aren\\'t special, or even that good at what they\\'re doing.  free birds is unappealingly staged and paced with an uneven sluggishness. it begs the question: since things always seem to be happening, why is it all so crushingly dull?  a joyless, misanthropic 105 minutes worth of \"comedy\" that rates as coen brothers at their worst. how one can take such a marvelous period and turn it into a voyage into hell is an imponderable mystery to this critic.  this one, directed by john glen, just follows the numbers, plodding from one unimaginative set piece to the next.  the movie is purely visceral, generating adrenaline, alarm, and even tears. berg manages to avoid high-minded seriousness while still respecting the material.   peppermint could have been at least good trash, but it decides to be an awkwardly-paced exercise in shallowness. if you want a high body count, step right in, but brains behind the brawns are sorely missed.  while the hidden agenda that eventually surfaces does strain credibility, foster\\'s ability to reign in the improbable ... allows this flight to deliver the requisite thrills.  as a romantic comedy, this film has nothing new to offer except the rise of a new comedy star, awkwafina.   comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.  estevez means well. but having your heart in the right place is no excuse for insipid ineptitude.  ralston seems to love living his life on the ragged edge of disaster, and boyle\\'s filmmaking rides that same narrow edge, to breathtaking effect.  the film works fine as stand-alone entertainment, but does irreparable harm to the series as a whole.  it\\'s not that \"hangover ii\" is a notably bad movie. it\\'s more that nothing in it seems to justify all the effort spent to add a new but nearly identical series of episodes to the original.  you simply haven\\'t had this much fun at the multiplex in a long, long time.  amy sedaris suits up as everyone\\'s favorite former-prostitute/drug addict-turned-high school student in the long-awaited--and quite funny--big-screen version of the cult tv series.  we see unadorned faces staring at the camera; afternoon shadows moving across a large, institutional-looking building; forlorn images of an abandoned amusement park; the misty, magical quiet of a swamp.  throughout the documentary are gorgeous images of teenagers with goofy, full-of-hope smiles that make your heart ache.  a beautifully shot but aggressively menacing film that is at turns irresistibly sumptuous and hide-your-eyes-behind-your-hands disturbing.  the concept is much cooler than the execution.  both [gyllenhaal and ledger] embody what that old waylon and willie song taught us -- \\'cowboys ain\\'t easy to love, and they\\'re harder to hold.\\'  an unsubtle film for unsubtle times, all the better for not backing down with what it\\'s trying to say or how it says it.  one long, extensively choreographed fight sequence in which \"mortal\" blows are delivered so often, and with so little lasting impact, that a brawl just becomes a brawl becomes a brawl.  one of bergman\\'s undisputed masterpieces is a seminal work of psychonalayis and metacinema, raising more complex questions about identity and role-playing than it could possibly answer, thus deliberately encouraging ambivalence and ambiguity.  somehow that revolutionary, empowering message never got through to dunn. his film seems sexually and psychologically arrested in the pathology that blocks coming out.  ... a frothy girl-power manifesto so briskly paced, sharply written and infectiously entertaining that its deficiencies seem as insignificant as a lightly chipped fingernail.  it\\'s so disappointing for the director of rosemary\\'s baby to have to stoop to something as desperate as pyrotechnics and nudity.  the film is put together too choppily to appreciate the bounce-off-walls athleticism of parkour.  confirms the perception that only losers attend high-school reunions.  if younger truly wanted to work out some fantasies on the big screen, prime is the dullest, most unimaginative way he could\\'ve achieved that goal.  you can always expect a little embellishment for any horror film or thriller that claims to be based on a true story or actual events. this one, however, doesn\\'t sell it.  merely an excuse for the viewer to delight in the hilarity generated by mr. cable guy breaking wind, vomiting, producing various gastric noises, etc.  on its own, \\'enough said\\' is a sweet and charming little movie - but there\\'s no question the loss of its beloved leading man lends the picture extra, unexpected pathos.  the story might perhaps be adequate for an animated film for children, with thor, odin and the others played by piglets. in the arena of movies about comic book superheroes, it is a desolate vastation.  while short on fresh ideas, the film works thanks to some strong performances and a script that provides just enough depth to render its characters more than just a collection of eccentricities.  if you thought the oscar-winning 2004 drama crash was heavy-handed, just wait until you see crossing over.  as fresh as [gatlif\\'s] view of flamenco may be, his dramatic ideas are excruciatingly trite.  what a mountain of crap this movie is.  when [it] remembers that it\\'s supposed to be a sweet piece of hokum, when it has the wit to leave attenborough and wilson on the screen together and forget about its rash of putative improvements, it does offer well-scrubbed family fare.  the sex scenes are pretty hot, though their power is diminished by the characters\\' limited intelligence.  perfectly enjoyable but perfectly forgettable.  the general playful tone... helps a great deal, and the cinematography and editing are appealingly glossy and smooth throughout.  it is, despite spielberg\\'s claims, neither a purehearted popcorn flick nor a paul verhoevenesque subversion, but something uneasily in between, cowed by the idea of the fanboy demographic.  for all its political pelting, this is most gripping when it focuses on the innocent people whose lives have been destroyed either by the terrorists or by this administration.  we have the feeling that kemp/thompson saw much of life through the bottom of a dirty glass and did not experience it with any precision. the film duplicates this sensation, not with much success.  a reconstituted blend of ghostbusters meets men in black with a pinch of the x-files.  while it\\'s true that the problems of two little people don\\'t amount to more than a hill of beans in stalin\\'s ussr, they\\'re real enough to the people experiencing them. we feel for them, even if the world can\\'t.  a doublethink cash grab, painting perpetrator as saviour and exploited victims on the fringes of society as empowering role models - figures of inspiration to make mainstream, uncritical audiences feel better about themselves.  aire is a film about mother courage. [full review in spanish]  it might be best to let the big guy live happily ever after.  the film is so wadded full with ideas that they come squishing out the sides.  much of the heavy lifting falls to watson, and, in such moments as the one where she must wipe out her family\\'s memories of her to protect them, she is more than up to the task.  navel-gazing and listless, mary magdalene is nevertheless an affecting, contemplative hagiography of a biblical figure which is more inclined towards an arthouse aesthetic than anything in the \"faith-based\" sub-genre.  lawrence reunites with her \\'hunger games\\' director for a sadistic, sexed-up, russian spy saga that is one long \"nyet.\"   made almost 50 years ago, the black-and-white french classic still grabs you by the throat.  the actors, particularly seyfried and redgrave, help make the movie\\'s romantic spirit contagious.  while there are some nicely gory moments, the film feels rather uninspired ...  a handsomely photographed movie of little consequence.  damon is superbly silly in this comic version of a beautiful mind.  the film\\'s greatest mystery turns out to be: why, with so much talent, does dark water never cross the tipping point?  what hurts it is spielberg\\'s dogged insistence on turning it into yet another of his seemingly endless middle-brow meditations on the travails of the middle-class family.  krampus is a toothless film on several levels.  trite characters, very well-worn clichés of sf cinema, and a mystery that is completely transparent. all about production design, and even that is familiar.  another beautifully-made and serious-minded celebration of having nothing to say.  you\\'ll never hear the phrase \"mind the doors\" in the same way again.  it\\'s clear that these guys were just having some fun making a movie, and that fun they had translates onto screen perfectly.   despite being marketed as historical fiction king arthur story, this film is actually a high octane full on fantasy film that showcases excalibur guiding arthur to his destiny. and it\\'s thrilling!   the plot doesn\\'t hold up but the chemistry between the two leads does  a breezy hour-and-ten-minutes long, this beautifully affecting film is less about these beloved characters than its aging filmmaker\\'s wistful reminiscences of cinema itself and a long lifetime\\'s worth of material pleasures.  if we can operate at the genius level in a given field, does that mean we must -- even if the cost is the sort of endless purgatory a bobby fischer has inhabited? it\\'s an interesting question, and this movie doesn\\'t avoid it.  essential to maintaining the powerful atmospherics is the superb cast, which includes nicole kidman as the surgeon\\'s unsuspecting wife.  what grounds the spectacle, pushing it beyond a two-hour ejaculation of sensation, is its yearning for innocence  the performances are uniformly excellent.  the truth is that this film is mostly plain work, done by rote, like any introductory potions class. the real fun -- and thrills and tears -- come next year.  capturing that particular age group, of those in their late 20s and early 30s, entering into adulthood with a certain reluctance and trepidation.  ballard\\'s sumptuous images exist only to distract from his rather conventional failings of craftsmanship.  bring the spouse and live vicariously.   hickenlooper seems unsure what he wants his film to be. is it a mid-life crisis film? is it a marriage-in-trouble film? or is it really classy neo-porn lite?  kudos to cuaron for crafting such a visually-captivating, surreal memoir of his troubled coming of age!   crass, offensive, vulgar, inane: there aren\\'t enough adjectives to effectively convey the endless agony that is humshakals.  zootopia is filled with lovable characters and a heartfelt message for kids - along with a layered subtext for adults that is both timely and moving.   the grand statement it wants to make plays shallow instead of deep, leaving the film too weak-kneed to carry the weight of its broken world.  this is a wilder, bigger thing than just another farmyard sink drama. there may be little you haven\\'t seen elsewhere, but there\\'s no denying the skill here.  deliberate, uncompromising, and very sad, bob clark\\'s quiet masterpiece is still one of the most inspired anti-war genre pics out there.  this self-promoting hollywood film wants everyone to feel good about hollywood...  another empty, heavily voice-overed perfume commercial.  pity the crowds expecting another cute comedy like \"date night\" who wind up at \"crazy, stupid, love.\" it\\'ll be like asking for a burger and getting served escargot.  like mccarthy\\'s book, the road is dark, bleak and nightmarish but also stirring and beautiful and optimistic: as long as life remains, the movie argues, there is always hope.  just isn\\'t clever or surprising enough: it\\'s complicated but conventional, strikes no sparks...[and] fails to juggle its myriad tones successfully.  ... sharply observed, with an endearing quirky sense of humor and a genuine affection for its setting.  my mutant power (and the boxoffice tingle of $199 million in one week) tells me \"the last stand\" is anything but last. it\\'s not even likely to be penultimate.  whatever muse drives malick, whose best work feels both found - in the sense of discovered in the shoot and edit - and profound, he could be accused of cheating on her in knight of cups, leapfrogging between unsatisfactory short-term conquests.  an endearingly straightforward, intimate character study and one that remains wholly relatable.  mcdonagh has a way with a line that is without compare, and he has put together a cast who knows how to sock it home. harrelson is excellent with a character who also takes unexpected turns that we aren\\'t prepared for.  irons and patel create a bit of magic with their mathematical dance, so even when brown\\'s script bogs down in cliché and the female characters are swept into the corner of every scene, the viewer has something meaty to process.  an emotionally devastating documentary [...] falls apart toward the end when it loses all objectivity and descends into hagiography.  the easy charm of stars miles teller and analeigh tipton more than compensates for a screenplay that never quite bridges the divide between old-fashioned romance and the cruder tone that seems par for the course in modern comedy.  simply awful...like a syfy network saturday night special that\\'s inexplicably escaped to the big screen.  you need to give \"love is strange\" your eyes and ears and attention, let it work its effects on you gradually, like the lovely chopin piano music that forms the spine of its soundtrack.  a convoluted tale of corruption within the ranks of the police  a japanese film that draws out our respect and compassion for a man whose life is turned upside down by the early onset of alzheimer\\'s.  the worst film ever made in scotland ...  one can\\'t help but feel that the disney-depp partnership has taken the series as far as it can go in this form, and short of a large-scale overhaul of the franchise, it may be best to set these particular pirates adrift for good.  leaves behind almost as many derisive laughs as dead bodies.  the film moves at a snails pace and while it shows off a lot of beautiful scenery, it takes about 30 minutes for something to happen outside of the initial hubbaloo that sets charlotte off in the first place.  the nice way to put it is to say it\\'s the second best film of the franchise. it\\'s also accurate to say that it\\'s a pale imitation of the original that\\'s worse on every level.   yes, you\\'ve seen much of it before, and the nervous james character is now officially a cliché. but stewart makes you care anyway. this, folks, is an actress.  this isn\\'t a movie. it\\'s a broadway musical captured on film.  a genuinely moving exploration of a complex mother-daughter relationship  headstrong women might have been hard to find in turn-of-the-century europe, but heroines like tautou\\'s are a dime a dozen in costume dramas, and there isn\\'t enough material detailing what makes her chanel a special case.  when the finale of your movie involves a twenty-minute fantasy battle between role-playing enthusiasts, it is safe to say you have lost your way.  an intriguing erotic thriller undone by a silly, generic ending.  limp anthology has brief nudity, language, adult themes.   it may be slight, but it\\'s also very funny, occasionally insightful, and a welcome throwback to those hallowed school daze.  penelope cruz is outstanding in an otherwise lame male fantasy.  bold and innovative, spiritually challenging--and some heads get chopped off.  it\\'s a movie by dog lovers, for dog lovers, that\\'s more concerned with being cute and cuddly than providing any meaningful insight or substance.  not knowing whether to be a comedy or a drama and often failing at both, there\\'s very little to recommend about this downer of a movie.  a warm and fun crowd pleaser.  reeves y bullock no interpretan el papel de su vida, sin embargo cumplen con las expectativas del público en un producto ligero de fin de semana.  the wolf of wall street is a film that speaks to our times, and it is saying some very important things if we care to listen.  ridley scott\\'s not made his third sci-fi masterpiece, but boy, has he come close.  predictable romcom send-up has racy sex scenes, language.  in action, the film is breathtaking, but as a whole it suffers from a relative lack of ambition.  what in lesser hands could have become an immaculately observed period piece instead soars to creative heights with its literate and knowing script.  after the setup, the air leaks out of the movie, flattening its momentum with about an hour to go.  captain underpants: the first epic movie perfectly captures the goofy spirit of its source material. plus, it has a theme song performed by weird al, so how can it go wrong?  the great wall is not a groundbreaking film by any means, but at least it\\'s fun  (scott) derrickson uses a visual sledgehammer. that tilts everything toward horror and dilutes the terrifying power of the supernatural darkness.   for all the fast cuts, the furious vibes, the faux sexiness, torque is canned and mighty flat.  rarely has a film felt so literally like a chore to watch.  in a word, it\\'s soulless.  when the universe \"expands\" in this way, it actually makes it seem so much smaller.  mind-numbing, formulaic twaddle.  dafoe proves to have the right blend of ruggedness and sensitivity for this conflicted hero.  high-class hokum 600,000 feet in orbit  the story\\'s metaphysical slant lends the proceedings a haunting and ruminative air.  phoenix has great production value, some nice special effects, some good acting, but overall impact wanes more than waxes. long on time, short on internal struggle.  expands a two-minute viral video into a feature-length dry procedural of city permits, bitty bat costumes, street closures and savvy social promotion  if bon voyage ... didn\\'t satiate your desire for films about the nazi occupation of france in world war ii, you\\'re in luck. another one has washed up on our shores, and it\\'s even better.  the sequel to the most startling box-office smash of recent years collapses over the finishing line with barely a breath of air still in its lungs.  this document is a testament of the past, when things were done differently: the funny clothes, technical mishaps, av effects and the fortunate non-existence of smartphones blocking the experience. [full review in spanish]  the movie proud mary might not be anything special in itself, but its heroine sure as hell is.  if you take even the slightest interest in politics, book for the accidental prime minister now. it is a film that takes you through an important era in indian politics and is also entertaining.   an animated film that takes familiar disney archetypes and twists them into vivid, imaginative shapes.  one of those genre-defying hybrids that are sometimes called dramedies, the savages tiptoes along a particularly fraught emotional tightrope, balancing observant humor and deep sadness with uncommon grace.  the movie is eerily photographed, but never suspenseful or scary, and eventually, events descend into goat-sacrificing silliness.  details feel wrong; the pace is skittish; the rise to fatal hysteria is rapid and unconvincing. finally you just lose all faith in it.  this is one of those \"why-oh-why?\" movies where you want to turn away from the terrible decisions unfolding on screen - but can\\'t.  this is a tedious tale badly told.  despite all the outrageous comedy and raunchy bathroom jokes, [the zuckers] create endearing characters that are likable.  perfectly serviceable b-movie noir.  for lovers of all things violent and vengeful, the equalizer is a treat  a well-acted, but overlong, clunky, and underwhelming satire.   it\\'s a horror-comedy without much horror or comedy, because the seriousness of the protagonists\\' baggage saps away most of the humor, and the laid back filmmaking undercuts any opportunity for scares.  \"suffragette\" feels like a documentary in its visuals, but at the same time drowns in subjectivity.  it\\'s an amazing and touching true story that will have you on the edge of your seat and may even cause you to shed a tear or two.  a muddled revenge crime drama.  if there\\'s a movie worse than this set for release this year, let\\'s hope the distributor has the good sense not to do it.  it\\'s a middle-of-the-road anthology but boasts great energy and a sense of humor that runs throughout, helping make even the mediocre entries watchable.  it\\'s clean, has all the requisite eye candy and slapstick for the younger set, and -- most distinguishing of all -- an uncommon level of sophistication for the adults.  more informative than emotional, the documentary catches some of the angst involved in such an undertaking, but always appears to be engaging with the subjects at a respectful arm\\'s length.  structurally and narratively amputated, volume 1 retains head and guts but loses its heart and gams to the second installment.  much like the onslaught of sword-and-sandal epics, the comic-book-adaptation boom has resulted in a decreased effectiveness of the subjects.  david frost\\'s soft approach to nixon got results. this doesn\\'t.  the plot device of \"woman in trouble meets woman triumphant\" has grown a little long in the tooth lately but that doesn\\'t mean it doesn\\'t work.  on the whole, war is both a reasonable possible conclusion to the ape\\'s arc and a solid preparation for whatever comes next.  even though the film is marketed as a road movie for kids, it barely has any road in it and that\\'s just the least of its flaws. [full review in spanish]  a movie about the difficulties of being a teenager and the main problems that affect mexican society with amazing performances. [full review in spanish]  a one-of-a-kind experience that will confound, befuddle and amaze.  the increasingly diverse french director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking, sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history.  there are no surprises in this story, only the anticipation of justice being done one bad guy at a time until the final showdown.  louis zamperini\\'s life would make a great movie, if only somebody knew how to make it.  a sweet, often poignant little film.  as an observer of the various dimensions and dynamics of families, [director kore-eda hirokazu] is a modern master.  girault presents situations through an extreme romantized lense, full of warmness, dim lights and lacking any comunication or beleivability for the characters and the spectator. [full review in spanish]  rest assured, these crises will be resolved, and helen will be enriched by the experiences. but going through them with her throws more sugar into your system than i can take.  it\\'s not the actors that are the problem, it\\'s the material they\\'ve been given. the dialogue, the antiquated sense of humor, the obviousness of so many plot mechanics.  hunt for the wilderpeople masks its earnest sweetness with a giggling distrust of authority, making it at once heartfelt and mischievous.  we spend 100 years developing an art form that breaks out of the musty auditoria of the 19th century and where does it get us? right back where we started.  the auteur sees himself in the aviator, whose competence makes believers out of skeptics and who - in a critique of effects-driven blockbuster filmmaking - argues that \\'computer simulations\\' mean nothing when divorced from the \\'human\\' element.   defiance groans under the weight of its deadly earnestness: it\\'s handsomely mounted yet strangely inert.  a brilliant follow up to bispuri\\'s ambitious debut, daughter of mine is an expertly crafted, richly told meditation on mother/daughter dynamics and what those roles truly mean  the story hasn\\'t changed much, nor have the characters. but the comedy is now crude instead of whimsical and its characters overblown caricatures instead of screwball personalities. a movie has been reduced to a sketch.  gibney\\'s movies are professional and solidly executed, informative if you go in underinformed but rarely surprising or aesthetically noteworthy.  a wonderfully quiet, serene portrait of carthusian life edited to reflect the rhythm of the monastic regimen.  like so many films by snl alumni, it struggles to keep up the pace, and a few good scenes - or skits - are all you get.  it\\'s pretty special stuff as offered up by donoghue and director lenny abrahamson.  musketeers isn\\'t the worst picture anderson has made in the last decade, but it\\'s depressingly representative of his work -- he\\'s always eager to dazzle, but clueless on how to engage.  sentimental dreck of the fluffiest order.  this may be the best movie he\\'s made. it\\'s in french, by the way.  so cautious in dealing with the subject matter, so anxious to avoid the slightest hint of sensationalism, that it ends up exceedingly attractive to look at but curiously bland dramatically.   \"in dubious battle\" marks an embrace of a kind of anonymous, fuddy-duddy traditionalist approach. in short, it\\'s maybe james franco\\'s best-crafted film to date, and also maybe his dullest.  has enough memorably disturbing images to stick in viewers\\' minds without any explanation needed.  (tsui hark\\'s) romp plays exactly like the sino-centric spin on an indiana jones adventure that its title suggests it should.  matches documentary authenticity with dramatic intensity.  when they say they don\\'t make movies like they used to, this is exactly the type of film they\\'re talking about.  an unbelievably hokey, and, in spite of the terpsichore on display, resolutely lead-footed piece of mawkish melodrama.  a lackluster action-adventure.  the film\\'s and nancy\\'s nonjudgmental tone gives it a distinctly modern feel.  there\\'s enough of a storyline here to keep younger space cadets moderately settled.  arthur is riddled with clichés, suffers from a trite - occasionally offensive - screenplay, and has flatter direction than any russell brand vehicle deserves. [but] i could watch [he] and ... greta gerwig flirt for hours on end.  nanking doesn\\'t tell us why decency and compassion completely break down from time to time. it just tells us something terribly modern and all too familiar.  it has \\'cult\\' written all over it - and like most cults you\\'ll either get it . . . or you won\\'t.   richly entertaining and technically innovative, but it\\'s also a movie with an outspoken point of view about the direction in which american culture ought to be headed.  the plot is simple and the movie doesn\\'t live up to expectations. [full review in spanish]   so devoid of any spark that it feels like watching someone\\'s boring vacation videos.  forced jokes, ridiculous characters and a bad plot may get a laugh and maybe that\\'s enough for many. [full review in spanish]  more of the same, yes, but it\\'s the same stuff without the anarchic glee that permeated its predecessor.  a comedy, too exaggerated and repetitive, that has its best moments when they are unpredictable. [full review in spanish]  \"the revenant\" should be seen for its exquisite scenery, its realistic portrayal of men living 200 years ago in an unforgiving environment, and for leo.  no, it\\'s not a movie about two first ladies married to adulterous husbands.  \"a bigger splash\"? more like a small trickle.  it\\'s sarah polley through and through: slightly too glum for its own good, but reeking of quality and feeling.  shanghai noon was fun and shanghai knights is more of the same -- just not as much fun.  ...shallow, clichéd, sentimental, and derivative; but the cast makes up for the plot\\'s deficiencies with an amiable charm that\\'s hard to resist.  given how obsessed we are with politics, we deserve better films about it and the men who shape our nation.   with geoffrey rush as his star, stanley tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of alberto giacometti in this biopic... the artist\\'s messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.  campion creates a nearly lethal dose of emotion-deprivation, turning spine tickling dread into something nearly dreadful.  a cringe-worthy confection...mom deserves better.  a powerfully engaging coming-of-age immigration sports documentary-style drama. and this unpredictable genre mash-up is pure magic.  utterly charming, graceful, and poignant.   what gives these episodes cumulative impact is the group portrait that emerges of a well-meaning country in a state of drift.  personal shopper is an uncanny mix of ghost story and personal drama that never feels, even for a moment, like it\\'s playing into any genre conventions whatsoever -- the film is entirely its own entity.  written and directed with efficiency, cheer, and a refreshing lack of look-how-meta-clever-we-are egotism, the movie references just enough of the original touchstones and punchlines to please those who lived it the first time.  director niki caro deftly intercuts josey\\'s story with the anita hill-clarence thomas hearings, a smart, subtle move to tie in the things all women have had to go through.  a disappointing sequel that can\\'t replicate the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational, muppetational qualities of the film that brought jim henson\\'s creations back into the limelight.  nice effects work, a relatively swift-moving narrative, sweet performances, and, by now, a well-worn premise prove inspiring this time out, and not deadening.  the film portrays this period as a golden era for journalism. in many ways it was a golden age, but the real heroes were the whistleblowers and reporters, and that\\'s no slight to the real risks editors and publishers like bradlee and graham took.  a tense buildup and a frenetically-paced final act combine for a fitting tribute to those who perished and the survivors of the disastrous oil rig explosion and resulting spill.  it\\'s an unintentionally comedic look at mankind\\'s selfish disinterest toward anyone in danger -- except for family.  cue multitudes of stolen moments.  more darkness than light, \\'a wrinkle in time\\' has much to iron out.  [a] calculatedly emotional, sterilizingly cleancut drama.  hallelujah, it\\'s fun.  the biggest waste of talent of any movie this year.  ever get the feeling the film you\\'re watching wasn\\'t actually finished?  eighteen short films, each done by a different director with a different cast and set in a different neighborhood of paris, je t\\'aime is a remarkable achievement.  the narrative dares to break the insular hermeticism reflecting that triangular intercommunication between sergio, sergei and peter. [full review in spanish]  few of the dialogue scenes match the expressiveness of vargas\\'s night-time street shuffle, or jourdain\\'s closing-credit solo.  even though the screenplay strains credibility at times, and the music really isn\\'t that great, the thoughtful premise is handled with sensitivity instead of crassness.   kenner\\'s sympathies are clear - \"don\\'t let them stack the deck!\" the film proclaims - and ultimately merchants of doubt does a much better job of making you think than convincing you of what to think.  an endearing blend of myth and melodrama that forthrightly explores family abuse in its own society.  this movie often plays like a super-expensive, 21st-century version of one of those \"star wars\" knockoffs made around 1980 by people who weren\\'t george lucas.  beck ... is very good on volume but not much for tension, suspense or frightening anyone.  to call the hunt gripping would be like calling annie hall funny. it is, but it\\'s also so much more than that.  overall, hummus! the movie was informative and well-framed.  wright has affectionately lampooned the horror and action genres in the past, but baby driver proves he is now a legitimate action director in his own right.  this is a slow-burning, very well acted film that contains, almost disconcertingly, a graphic sex scene, a strange star-cameo very late on, and something close to a hollywood ending.  j-lo, reminds us why she got to be famous in the first place.  miracles from heaven is manipulative, blunt, super-christian propaganda that\\'s dignified and deeply moving in its own way.  the more you think about it, the more you see all the subtextual tricks that were missed.  all told - and this film knows exactly who its audience is - a reminder of what famously enriching company habitual stoners are.  indeed, it\\'s the best movie comedy to come out of england since monty python packed up the circus.  plays like an update of the time-honoured full monty formula - public exhibitionism vanquishes english emotional reserve - for a post-glee world.  woefully unsuitable for children with its decades-old nods to r-rated films, \\'hoodwinked too! hood vs. evil\\' is a far cry from the much cleverer original.  all mr. woodcock gives us is mediocre comedy at its finest.  although younger children will doubtless love it, hotel for dogs is too often cute for its own sake to really entertain anyone else.  as always, hart unleashes his manic energy on the audience, but his heart doesn\\'t seem to be in it the way it was in the original. maybe he\\'s getting tired of the shtick, too.  beyond the hype there is an interesting story here, and luckily, morgan spurlock found it.  thriller movies should never make the audience feel safe. bird box is a bullock vehicle that lacks emotion. [full review in spanish]  the scenery ain\\'t bad but the laughs are tumbleweed-sparse in \"the ridiculous 6,\" a western sendup so lazy and aimless, it barely qualifies as parody.  srong on character and atmosphere but weak on story and excitement.  all these moments are held together by stanton, who gets to have the final word on his career. the opening credits read \"harry dean stanton is lucky,\" and it\\'s clear throughout the film that he was, and so were we.  the story reaches a critical mass of muddled implausibility when an already suspicious protagonist is revealed to be homicidally untrustworthy and the cloverfield beastie gets a moment in the sun.  a movie star and his neglected daughter bond while partaking in the celeb-filled glamour of the chateau marmont.  in his attempt to spoof destination weddings of the bankrupt and the famous, vikas bahl, (who also directed that gem, queen) forgot to take a script along.  read the wikipedia page. you\\'ll learn more.  chazelle tells armstrong\\'s story with certainty and verve.  law tears into his role like he\\'s like one of shakespeare\\'s most scabrous lost characters somehow unleashed in the modern world, and he clearly relishes the grit and the gristle.  with piercing hilarity, the kindergarten teacher dares us to work out for ourselves, from moment to moment, whether lisa is a hero, a monster, or something in between.  rozema\\'s handling of the entangled amours and social gamesmanship at mansfield park is delightful...it\\'s impure austen, but potent moviemaking.  a genial, shambling portrait of a first, obsessive infatuation.  uzumaki progresses like the life cycle of a butterfly, only the subjects begin as human beings and contort into giant snails, powerless to stop their bodies from betraying them.  annie hall expanded woody allen\\'s canvas to incorporate real wisdom alongside the punchlines.  superbly crafted grisham potboiler runs for over two hours, feels like forty-five minutes.  pleasantly goofy horror time-killer.  identity doesn\\'t outfox the audience; it just makes us feel like suckers.  zodiac, the latest film from director david fincher, is among his best  the rare film that manages to be simultaneously bland and offensive.  smith keeps the fog, mist and rain machines working overtime, but to such little purpose that black death often looks like outtakes from fiddler on the roof.  a gripping, political thriller packed with tremendous performances and supremely confident direction by george clooney.  in the end, despite its quirky twists on the genre, wyrmwood is just another zombie flick, riffing on its predecessors and hoping that\\'ll suffice.   visually, it\\'s tedious, comprising staid, greyish greens. what\\'s weirder is that the film is in english (though the accents are german), a distancing device that distracts.  there\\'s no way i can recommend this movie to anyone much beyond the tooth fairy believement age, but i must testify it\\'s pleasant and inoffensive, although the violence in the hockey games seems out of place.  stylish, witty and beautifully shot, though very much from the viewpoint of charming robber forrest; a thief with a gun is still a thief with a gun. spacek and redford delight; i never believed in the relationship between forrest and the cop on his tail.  hirokazu kore-eda\\'s new film is the sleeper hit of 2018. the japanese filmmaker has become a master of humanity, his films are true reflections of how we as flawed individuals are embraced by those closest to us, family.  enough laughs and entertainment value you have to give them more than a little credit for what they\\'re able to pull off and get away with.  both anderson\\'s most tightly wound and funniest film in years, lacking the melancholy charm of the royal tenenbaums or moonrise kingdom perhaps, but more than making up for it in terms of elegantly capering contrivance.  the movie is charming in spite of itself, even if you don\\'t really care about the characters, the mystery or the resolution.  the problem with the film is that that story, hackneyed when it first made it to the screen in 1984, has grown only more tired over the past 26 years.  brie larson and jacob tremblay offer a couple of performances so out of series that are literally unforgettable. [full review in spanish]  blade ii is certainly not without interest... but mostly, it looks and feels so much like a video game that some members of the audience will feel their thumbs twitching before the final reel.  a traditional zombie film introduced as a romantic-comedy and infected with a sly british-cum-\"the simpsons\" intelligence and sensibility.  movies like unbroken don\\'t work if you lose sight of what makes them unique.  an overly earnest, melodramatic musical mishmash   repeats bits and even characters from the earlier films, hoping viewers won\\'t notice, or that lightning will strike again.  watching a spy sit on the couch waiting for text messages from higher-ups may not sound as compelling as a le carré novel, but it\\'s a necessary build to a pulse-pounding third act that reveals how lives are destroyed by half-truths and hearsay.  there is a curious absence of development in this film.  is it sci-fi? fantasy? idiocy? mostly it\\'s a droning mess -- pretty to look at but confounding to the point where you just don\\'t care any more.  this is a solid family film material, although one suspects the children will get a little more out of it than their parents.  depalma repeating himself is better than most filmmakers saying something for the first time.  the cinematography here is enough to make you swoon. would that the story were equally compelling.  ...an intriguing and seemingly foolproof scenario that\\'s rendered increasingly irrelevant by fiala and franz...  a thoughtful perspective on attitudes to homosexuality in the church and polish society and chyra\\'s strong performance make this a poignant drama.  part two is where things start to get more serious, and the film suffers for it.  features even more toddlers acting in a way only collectors of velvet paintings will consider irresistible.  the characters are realistically flawed and the film tackles grief in a way that is completely believable. james mcavoy and jessica chastain are perfectly imperfect together. but the unpolished script slows it down and makes it feel unpleasantly erratic.   the return is a slow burn that\\'s often way too slow, feeling stretched to meet a running time that\\'s still under 90 minutes.  david cronenberg meets don delillo at last, and it\\'s as if all the angels of heaven have come together. and said nothing.  if you\\'re going to champion style over substance, you\\'ll want danny boyle providing the style.  what starts out as a delightful black comedy and social commentary ends up, at best, as a guilty pleasure where i had a hard time sorting out the intentional from the unintentional laughs.  alas, there\\'s no real sense of tension as the story (credited to three writers) lurches toward a by-the-numbers ending.  magically, unexpectedly, most funkily, get on up feels fresh and crisp as the godfather of soul\\'s keenest moves.   eastwood delivers a ferociously emotional tale that matches, and in some respects surpasses, the artistry of last year\\'s mystic river.  action-movie aficionados know to look forward to besson\\'s spatially energized productions, and the new film taken maintains his high standards.  one might say that the act of killing and the look of silence... are two halves of a diptych - or uneasy neighbours, like the former members of the komando aksi killing squads and their families, and the families of their victims.  garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work.  the director manages to extract precisely the same numbed unease from a murder, an embrace, or a moment of dead time in which someone looks out the window.  a complete delight. i laughed, i gasped, and i cried, as did the entire screening audience i watched the film with. how many other films can boast that kind of a balancing act?  in the end, this adaptation may not be all that different than effective screen tearjerkers of the past, but in staying true to its source material, its infinity is bound to be a little bigger than most.  with a sprawling production that spans many international locations, traitor is efficient and convincing.  alpha is a tale that transcends time and space to tell a beautiful story of friendship between humans and animals.  sure, it\\'s a fairly broad sex comedy, but it\\'s a sweet one.  it\\'s hard not to appreciate the astute ways the script captures the moment when carefree childhood turns into the loss of innocence.  shannon shows new shades in her deft handling of a tragedy she\\'s tasked with bearing. further proof that when it comes to drama, comedy actors are often the experts.  so utterly unimaginative it doesn\\'t even count as hommage; it\\'s just a smudgy copy of a still chilling original.  far too high-and-mighty to truly be moving.  fans will undoubtedly thrive on every second. for the rest of us, monster is precisely that: a creature powerful but ungainly.  bride of chucky strings together a series of humorous asides and knee-jerk shock tactics.  the movie might make for a good book, but it\\'s too awkward and lacks the necessary action for a film. and williams\\' rather sluggish approach doesn\\'t help much. eventually, we just aren\\'t interested in tagging along with him.  the result is a well-acted, well-reasoned two-hander that struggles to swerve around the contrivances of the genre.  an unusual, oddly satisfying film that\\'s part road movie and part emotional drama.  ...the sort of light, breezy entertainment that feels a lot more like george roy hill or peter bogdanovich than it does ridley scott.  i\\'m thinking dan brown\\'s robert langdon books weren\\'t meant to be made into movies.  this sequel to fletch, in which chase played novelist gregory mcdonald\\'s los angeles newspaperman-detective, seems to have a chip on its shoulder, daring an audience not to laugh.  with a handful of solid laughs and a modicum of snappy dialogue, it\\'s liable to amuse, if not overwhelm, an audience seeking casual, forgettable entertainment.  sometimes borderline risible, but even so, one can\\'t but fail to be impressed it got made at all, given the subject is really mostly of interest to design geeks and those fascinated by intellectual property law.  tale of tales is a mixed bag of stories-but the bag itself is made of the finest visual velvet.  reminds us that from the bitter rivalries to the torn jerseys worn in pickup games to the dreams of gridiron glory, sports teams belong to the fans.  everything is more tentative, more generic.  vividly rendered but increasingly repetitive and aimless.  there is considerable satisfaction in seeing these tyrants of high finance live up to their image as the new villains of modern cinema, but even more satisfying are tykwer\\'s superbly staged action set pieces.  doesn\\'t necessarily make for a bad movie, in this politically alienated time we are currently living in, it does leave me worrying that it will deepen the racial and socio-economic divide in this country.  in a speech toward the end of the final year, obama muses that while history zigs and zags, \"the trendlines, ultimately, will be in the direction of a less violent, more empathetic, more generous world.\" if only it were so.  highly compelling and entertaining.  the movie is a missed opportunity. it has all the ingredients of a delightfully twisted, sleek little thriller. but with all that extra padding, mr. brooks is just one bloated mess.  rudo y cursi never quite figures out what it wants to be. is it a sports comedy? a tale of sibling rivalry? a look at mexico\\'s gritty underbelly, set against a soccer backdrop?  one of the most relentlessly abusive movies you will ever see - the dialogue is a non-stop torrent of profanity, and the action consists of one brutal beating after another. yet it cries out to be seen.  it\\'s titanic meets gladiator but not as good as either. if you don\\'t have time to read the rest of the review, that should do you just fine.  terrifically entertaining blockbuster that, for once, gets everything right.  the film is touching because it is very honest.  there are less laughs in this tired threquel, which continues to revel in its not-quite-a-swear surname and the ups and downs of family life, this time with an added emphasis on kids and mortality.  with a screenplay so childish it might as well have been written in crayola, the heat is at its best when it simply gives the tremendously talented mccarthy room to improvise.  ugh, arthur is everything that\\'s wrong with remakes wrapped up in a one hundred minute package.  even as it acknowledges its inspirations, manmarziyaan strikes out in decidedly different directions.  duvernay\\'s look at martin luther king\\'s 1965 voting-rights march against racial injustice stings with relevance to the here and now. oyelowo\\'s stirring, soulful performance as king deserves superlatives.   one of the funniest movies of the year, and in its own loony way, it\\'s a sharp, dead-on satire.  nakata - here making his english language debut - fails to drum up much in the way of tension from the plot\\'s hoky attempt to exploit fears about the existence of online suicide clubs.  the third time out for the vampire-hunting superhero is no charm.  the plot keeps you guessing and is constantly throwing the characters off track; only the camp factor prohibits you from caring quite as much as you should.  throw in a couple of ugly new characters and one semi-nauseating barf joke, and \"the nut job 2\" marks the emergence of a consistently tone-deaf animated franchise.  this unnerving and frustratingly opaque drama focuses on a teenage boy who distrusts his own memories and present reality.   we gotta give shannon credit for staying in fine schoolgirl form for superstar\\'s 90 minutes or so of teen silliness.  most action movies these days forgo the script in favor of slam-bang visuals and stunts, but basic actually suffers from too much plot.  the problem is that jp3 operates mostly on a 12-year-old\\'s level. for the rest of us it\\'s deja vu all over again.  a hilarious, acerbic political satire of a kind rarely seen on american screens.  reduces global terrorism to a rubik\\'s cube suitable for an evening\\'s entertainment. if that doesn\\'t make you vaguely ill, by all means take this thriller for the shallow, gimmicky \"ride\" it aspires to be.  by focusing on the power of cannily staged collective action to turn the tide of public opinion, selma achieves a contemporary relevance that few historical dramas can ...  vijay antony also scores as a composer, delivering good melodies like \\'arumbey\\' and \\'nooraai\\'. both songs are already popular.  sweet, charming...and not particularly funny for even a moment.  a comedy that feels as if it were dreamed up in the wee hours between bong hits and shots of tequila.  david gordon green somehow brings together the poetic sensibility of his independent art movies and the humorous lowbrow non sequiturs of his studio comedies; the results are one of a kind and often weirdly moving.   a vital if less than objective slice of film journalism on the u.s.\\'s troubled history in the third world.  quiet moments after big decisions are where the power lies in this absorbing french drama.  the performances and luscious cinematography are highlights of \"the light between oceans\"; it didn\\'t overwhelm me with feels but certainly is a worthy entrance into what is hopefully a satisfying award season.  guy ritchie\\'s take on arthurian myth is a misbegotten mash-up of sword-and-sorcery action fantasy and geezers-on-a-mission caper. it\\'s all booming cgi and lairy banter. bish bash bosh!   at certain moments, watching it felt like inhaling laughing gas mixed with helium.  in such able hands, the film transcends its generic restrictions.  it doesn\\'t take a conspiracy theorist to detect dark skies\\'s thinly veiled conservatism, and it doesn\\'t take an undue alarmist to be disturbed by the implications of this sort of fear-mongering.  a thin layer of gender jokes around a lot of recycled indiana jones predicaments, cliffs, snakes, monuments and charging animals. manages to be feel both too eventful and monotonous at the same time  forty-five minutes in, i was already glancing at my watch and wondering why the only lively actress in this film was playing the dead girl. go figure.  the script is based almost entirely on audiences buying for one second that a financially strapped andy would ever take joyce on an impulsive road trip of this nature, for reasons so ridiculous.  it\\'s as much an auditory narrative as a visual one, which makes perfect sense.  the funniest movie of 2013  while it alludes to themes concerning xenophobia, communication and social responsibility, ultimately the film amounts to little more than a collection of stark, uneven vignettes.  the film belongs to garcia, who is in literally every shot. wafting over garcia\\'s face at different moments are contentment, frustration, loneliness, disappointment, happiness.  if you think it\\'s a good idea to begin a movie for children by killing off a young boy in an industrial accident as his father looks on, raise your hand. anyone?  a grand adventure, thrillingly told.  grassroots is an incredibly unimaginative and painfully dull film -- perhaps one of most erroneous entries of the year.  as the black-and-white archive footage of the trenches and front lines floods into sickly greens and oranges, a 100-year gap suddenly springs shut.  a spright, persistently funny look at a woman flailing in a comic swirl of mid-life turmoil....bridget is in her mid-40s here, so what [we] now need is one more film where we see bridget in her 60s trying to bring up a 21st century teenager.  but like ripley and his mission, this gorgeous film sabotages the bizarre journey it originally offered.  the last samurai earns every minute of its near two-and-one-half hour running length. there\\'s no fat to trim, and no sense that scenes have been included to pad the ego of the director and/or his star.  senior-citizen buddy comedy has salty language, sex.   at least it means well.  superficial and unsatisfying...  there are some amusing ideas here and there, but they\\'re not developed into anything particularly memorable.  the conflicted pacifism of \\'munich\\' suggests spielberg\\'s vision is maturing.  kingdom of heaven lands somewhere between oliver stone\\'s yawn-inducing alexander and troy, the brad pitt pecs flexer, as sand-and-sandal entertainment.  it\\'s a film that swears by the golden formula of crowd-pleasing sentimentality: let viewers laugh at the struggles and share in the triumphs.  outbreak movie that devolves into yet another zombie knockoff.  since there always seems to be more going on in the head of the film\\'s director than in the head of the man playing andrei, the system did not work for me.  this oddball little concoction from the lonely island group of saturday night live fame manages to navigate a sweet center with the utmost precision.  biting but good-natured, incisive but not preachy, this is the kind of self-reflective comedy that can bring america together.  match point is a good movie -- a good, solid movie.  it\\'s the first von trier film that is not a tiresome practical joke on the audience.  one of the weaker entries in the series.  mira nair mistakenly makes the conniving becky a symbol of modern feminist pluckiness.  it\\'s the rare film that gets deep into low income inner city life and zeroes in on what motivates those whom society tends to forget.  the final sequence, in which the directors boldly refuse any neat tying-up of their story, is bracingly intelligent. lawlor and molloy are real talents with a distinctive, if evolving, film-making language of their own.  i don\\'t know much about ballet, and i liked the elaborately detailed la danse, but i suspect dance buffs are going to devour it.  it may be that coppola was right to put off filing this last installment all these years; from the evidence here, he had nothing more to say.  the dark knight is noisy, jumbled, and sadistic.  not as good as borat, but thankfully not bruno, there are some huge laughs to be had. and no, i\\'m not praising the film because aladeen threatened me ... though i wouldn\\'t put it past him.  i ended up really enjoying it...and looking forward to the sequel we are clearly being prepared for. sherwood forest and all.  for a film so full of automotive iconography, it\\'s a conclusion that remains frustratingly in the middle of the road.  ...the dardennes have fashioned their most accessible and relatable drama yet, one that works as a suspense thriller even as it exposes some miserable machiavellian truths and darwinian terrors.   appealing not to the lowest common denominator but the shortest, i.e., the toddler set, barred due to the r rating. or, as one young lad said to his friend in the sandbox: \"waaaaaah!\"  jersey boys is a solid watch that seeks to deepen the emotion of the jukebox musical.  changeling is little more than a frustrating missed opportunity that\\'s dressed to the nines, but a day late for the party.  while the film showcases moments of enormous power, there is something missing; perhaps it\\'s subtlety, or perhaps it\\'s the emotional connection the movie so desperately wants to make, but in the end, can\\'t quite achieve.  overall, beats is a good film. welsh\\'s intentions are clear and his passion is palpable.   clearly a vanity project, smith perhaps imagines this plot device will signify to the world that he\\'s ready to pass the action hero mantle on to his son, but it takes more than nepotism to make a movie star.  it\\'s not a total descent into romantic hell, but it gives a comprehensive tour of the upper circles.  forget evolution, this franchise needs a hard reset.  the series is losing its steam.  the killer\\'s final lines suggest a gleeful, pitch black perversity that the rest of shield of straw could have used, but instead it\\'s a thoroughly below average genre flick that\\'s empty on ideas and entertainment value.  this is a film that appeals to the head far more than to the heart, making for a portrait that seems somewhat less than complete.  mike nichols\\' fast-talking political comedy says every word but osama bin laden.  a stellar documentary highly suggested for horror buffs, film lovers, and aspiring filmmakers alike.  jude law\\'s dom remains an artificial construct, never the least bit real or empathetic, rather a creature of fiction - and an implausible one at that.  manhattan is nothing more than a trite christmas present from lopez. this film seemed to last longer than some of her relationships.  full of cliches and the very stereotypes against which director spike lee rails, \"miracle at st. anna\" is a television movie that\\'s far below the capabilities of one of the most talented living film directors.  the movie, which is as visually stunning as anything you could hope to see put on celluloid, still manages to feel emotionally hollow.  in essence, the film is exactly what one comes to expect in the telling of the story. hardwicke brings absolutely nothing to the table, except for a colorless palette. the actors struggle to invest what are essentially plaster saints with some verve, but  the filmmakers are obviously hoping that they are making up in mood what they\\'re failing to provide in narrative logic, but a guy staring at static is a guy staring at static.  a glorified powerpoint presentation interspersed with commentary by people of questionable qualifications who aim to incite paranoia with propaganda, conspiracy theories and straw-man arguments.  garrel carefree films with continuity on the same subjects of always and with conflicts and similar personages. [full review in spanish]  especially well handled are the screen realizations of dunaway\\'s premonitions. they look like a blurred videotape, as she explains to jones at one point, a conception which works well on screen.  the movie rarely conveys the import of what these kids accomplished: as depicted here, their cultural revolution seems no more noteworthy than a day spent at the mall.  if it suffers, it mostly only suffers in comparison to the other ocean\\'s films.  ...the most cinematic elements of the novel are the weakest parts of the movie.  the filmmakers and writers have messed with the bloodsucking legend, supplying stunning visuals but not much bite.  the way one of the most exciting contemporary filmmakers plays with the narrative is an undeniable triumph. [full review in spanish]  seeing that big red \"s\" on the big screen again is an exciting experience. welcome, home, supe. we missed you.  vanity fair is a timeless story about life lived, and a skewering of upper class society. am i less of a man for falling in love with this female friendly movie?  a full 120 minutes dedicated to the hilarious comic notion that white people can\\'t dance (hee, hee - it\\'s funny because it\\'s true, we\\'re so lame!)  the audience paid for money shots, and money shots are what they get.  mercifully, it\\'s a mad dash to the final finish line.  neeson isn\\'t going to win an oscar for this but he\\'s re-affirmed his position as hollywood\\'s favourite and least likely action star.  bad moms may not surprise you, but it will make you laugh. quite a lot, actually.  self-consciously written and directed redemption saga that\\'s certainy not as compelling as other dramas in this british gangland genre.  as is, jones is entertaining, but would have been a lot better if it wasn\\'t geared toward families.  this movie has everything to do with estevez\\'s needy ego, and nothing to do with bobby kennedy. it is a disgrace.  lacks credibility by pushing the delusory envelope.  an equally tender and devastating father-and-daughter effort that\\'s handled with supreme sensitivity and shot with unwavering kindness.  likely to remain the best movie of the year.  never before have i seen [dafoe] display the particular emotions that he displays in this film.  strange and darkly beautiful, a slave to no master\\'s rhythms or rules other than its own.  the cameos are distracting, the plot loses its rhythm before disintegrating completely and the seemingly endless decapitations and brutal deaths will lead even the most hardened of action fans to seek religion after the credits roll.  it\\'s like subtlety heard the purge was starting and took off running.  house bunny\\'s legally blonde roots show.  too generic to offer many scares  let\\'s hope the humor is intentional; it\\'s frankly hard to tell.  a fun adventure that always seems to get mixed up in my memory with mary poppins, and while they share similarities, this one stands out on its own as a great childrens film.  \"straight outta compton\" goes right to the heart of what made n.w.a. one of the most defiant groups of all time.  doesn\\'t even consider itself surprising enough to tack on a question mark.  there are a few hiccups from the book\\'s transition to screen, but more often than not, noyce\\'s picture is an entertaining and thoughtful adaptation.  there is no shortage of trouble, violence and humiliation awaiting them and twists and a growing sense of love and acceptance, on both sides. this is a buddy story to end \\'em all.  mcg tries to turn this means war into a cool pop confection along the lines of his charlie\\'s angels movies. but pouring on the douchey hipness and charm only makes things worse.  firsttime teaming of cary grant and audrey hepburn, a natural, gives the sophisticated romantic caper an international appeal, plus the selling points of adventure, suspense and suberb comedy.  the second part in the arabian nights saga slowly but surely raises a middle finger to the portuguese establishment.  tugs at the heartstrings like a toe-fingered harpist.  unfortunately, the script of anesthesia supports the ballast of an excessive verbosity and the proposed subplots don\\'t acquire a greater dramatic density. [full review in spanish]  kevin smith hasn\\'t matured enough to actually make a good comedy, but he has accrued enough casting wisdom to elevate his latest homegrown material with the effervescent seth rogan and elizabeth banks.  it\\'s a simultaneously modest and massively ambitious undertaking, so original in its conception and so successful in its execution that it deserves to be remembered as a landmark achievement.  management is ultimately undone by its own bland idiosyncrasies. it\\'s nothing but a mismanaged opportunity.  it simply isn\\'t satisfying, and for all mckay\\'s refusal to succumb to clichéd dramatics the movie needs something.  what pinter and branagh present is a much more wicked, cold, disturbing film that is even more confined than the original.  can a film be true to a classic literary source and still seem fresh? the answer is yes, and the proof is the new adaptation of jane eyre.   initially, it seems as if viewers are in for the same sort of frat-boy nonsense that sandler flings out with virtually all his live-action projects. thankfully, the movie soon shies away from that position and instead manages to deliver genuine laughs.  the question of just why audiences need (or want) a rebooted 3d origin story for a film franchise only a few year\\'s cold remains to be convincingly answered.  like a family scrapbook - benn himself approved the final cut - what is contained here is carefully curated, chosen to represent in a certain way but thanks to benn\\'s unnerring conviction, is no less fascinating for that.  jab tak hai jaan (jthj) is yash chopra\\'s last film as director and it\\'s a film rich in philosophy, poetic love and honest emotions.  the film might have been more charming with ray harryhausen effects than with cgi  it\\'s easy to get seduced by the sumptuous cinematography of \"the song of scorpions,\" but all that beauty becomes mere window-dressing since the script is too weak to support the potentially interesting story.  good, or bad, the entire crew is back and looking buff and beautiful. and who cares if only a precious few of them can act when all anybody needs to do is grunt and grip a steering wheel as if their checkered careers depended on it.  the present edition, in spite of an impressive cast, is a blood bath that is more violent than any before, but to no avail.   there are none of the big laugh-out-loud moments one would expect from these two very talented and hilarious performers.   ...hanks\\' and vardalos\\' treatment of a middle-aged joe heading back to the classroom is about as believable as rodney dangerfield\\'s back to school - and not half as entertaining.  a haunting, funny, beautifully austere film about obsession, delusion and fantasy, all held together by the remarkable, and the remarkably still, performance by rinko kikuchi.  [green book]... flees from the typical trappings of the biopic genre to which it belongs, offering a quite universal story. [full review in spanish]  a flat, joyless affair.  hokey doesn\\'t even begin to describe it.  a shattering tale of bravery and unrewarded loyalty.  stanley nelson\\'s studious history shows that even without the law enforcement campaign of disinformation, infiltration, and assassination, the black panthers would have imploded on their own.  team lewis has done a memorable job flushing out this complicated man.  file this one in the category of entertaining historical fiction. there are facts here, but one must possess more than a passing familiarity with history to be able to spot them.  ethan hawke and sarah snook, who plays the unmarried mother, are nearly ideal casting for these characters. they\\'re engagingly enigmatic-a requirement for playing mystery men-yet they also react to each other body and soul.  it is a fabulous \"what if?\" and siegel\\'s screenplay squeezes drama out of every possible story permutation.  the woman in black has lovely period atmosphere. unfortunately, it doesn\\'t have much else besides atmosphere.  despite a few good ideas and flashes of genius in the script, the whole film is a total bore.  there\\'s a real joy there -- genuine feelings of warmth that the cinema rarely manages to convey with such unalloyed sincerity.  as it should be with a film like this, the most fascinating aspect is the examination of kusama\\'s process, its evolution, and the psychology that drives it.  overlong and overwrought, orphan stays faithful to every cliché of the genre.  side effects points out, but never didactically, just how broken our systems have become, whether medical, governmental, or economic.  ayoade is better at establishing a road map of what \"submarine\" is supposed to be rather than pulling all its elements together cohesively.  it hurts to say this because i was hoping i wouldn\\'t have to type \"post-apocalyptic\" for awhile, but who knew denzel would make it worth the trip?  on the basis of their three feature films, directors phil lord and christopher miller are masters of transforming unlikely source material into something wonderful.  cruel comic mishaps may be this movie\\'s raison d\\'être, but they are softened at every turn by the gentle humanity of the city\\'s inhabitants, and by the unspoken sense that everything will turn out fine in the end.  the term \"pass over\" is loaded with meanings in antoinette nwandu\\'s gut-punch of a play.  writer-director rod lurie\\'s remake of the notorious straw dogs isn\\'t a terrible movie. it\\'s just not an exceptional one, a liability that increases exponentially with the quality of the original film.   there\\'s just one problem: the story.  what price, happiness?  \"this is the height of my career,\" says jason statham sarcastically in his latest potboiler ...  though alan clarke\\'s original film still has the edge, this perhaps has more relevance for a new generation of cinemagoers.  the drama never swamps the film\\'s humour, and it combines a glossy hollywood sense of wonder with that classic star trek optimism. in the uncertain world we live in, it couldn\\'t feel more timely.  a capably done account of a presidential career that was wrecked by a crime that was unnecessary.  within the canon of boston gangster movies, this one is decidedly of the first order.  the slasher stuff isn\\'t half bad, but you have to suffer through comedy material that feels like glass in your brain.  delivered with all the subtlety of a crotch to the face, magic mike xxl is one of the most cynical, shallow sequels in recent memory.  how such a franchise became one of hollywood\\'s most successful, i\\'ll never understand.  man on a ledge flirts with b-movie greatness but comes up short thanks to the far-fetched plot device used to power a clunky hybrid of heist flick/hitchcockian wrong-man thriller.  as the perfect antidote to dr. dolittle 2\\'s sappy blandness, the relentlessly inventive and entertaining cats and dogs comes along at just the right time.  taking over screenwriting duties from the original\\'s scott lobdell and straining the silliness past breaking, director christopher landon mounts a sequel that forgets to be scary.  the wachowski brothers disappear down the rabbit hole with the matrix reloaded.  regrettably, an overblown finale and redundant trick ending undercut the mild subversiveness of what\\'s gone before.  surprisingly smart and filled with homage, paul is crass and a little rough around the edges, but thoroughly enjoyable.  this s&m satire teeters on the verge of sleaze and exploitation but never descends into those domains due to maggie gyllenhaal\\'s exquisite performance in a tricky role.  my pick: the animated short of the year surely must be domee shi\\'s \\'bao,\\' a bittersweet reverie on motherhood that features one of the most hilariously shocking moments onscreen this year.  even if - despite the fact - men still feel the need to point out the obvious in 2019, bader ginsburg and [director mimi] leder are much-appreciated proof that change takes time, is arduous and worth it.  the movie references may strike some as in-jokey, but guest\\'s likeable film has enough jaundiced sideswipes and lighter chuckles to see it through its slacker spells.  at heart a philosophical allegory that pits cruise\\'s nihilism against foxx\\'s optimistic humanism  bone-chillingly told and beautifully made, ghost stories is an expert twist on an evergreen genre.  few social scientists are able to enliven an issue like connolly and anderson, and few documentarians have their dramatic intuition.  the words thinks it can outsmart us...providing one of those \"what if\" endings that raises such questions. without some idea of the possible answer, however, all we get is frustration.   the 5th wave is an unintentionally humorous excuse for dumbed-down science fiction filmmaking. it\\'s painful to watch and as uninteresting as toenail fungus.  a good vengeance thriller without flourishes or concessions. [full review in spanish]  a riveting drama that takes us into territory previously unexplored in gangster movies.  if you love movies in the very sinews of your imagination, you should experience the work of guy maddin.  if you\\'re partial to cats and don\\'t mind a bit of saccharine with your social realism, it\\'s the kind of movie to leave you purring in approval.  it is by far the funniest, most inventive and perfectly crafted comedy of the year.  it makes very few promises it can\\'t keep, but also goes halfway out on every limb it can find, risking next to nothing, sights permalocked on par.  the film\\'s pacing is usually either poky or too frenetic, almost never at the right clip to make even kiddie slapstick success.  i cannot in good conscience, however, recommend that anyone, man, woman or child-pay money to see this film, as being forced to sit in a cinema for the film\\'s 2-hour and 30-minute runtime was devastatingly exhausting.  animal requires a fairly high level of suspension of disbelief, but if you are willing to give it a try, you can enjoy a very intriguing thriller / character study. [full review in spanish]  instead of meticulously matching clues to revelations, it turns hercule poirot, agatha christie\\'s famous detective, into an unappealingly emotional holmes.  my interest waxed and waned. the set up for the film seemed to take eons. frank overstuffed the script with exposition, multiple subplots and some seemingly unnecessary sequences. just as i was ready to dismiss the movie, he switched gears.  costner and preston\\'s convincing work together go a long way in keeping the audience interested and involved.  the express finesses a cinematic hat trick: it\\'s entertaining, deeply moving and genuinely important.  a plodding, lazy and ravishingly dull biopic about a vicious and genuinely fascinating crime family set in the early eighties.  while zahn and davies offer amazing performances, bale\\'s starring turn often falls flat. herzog doesn\\'t give him much to work with: the writer-director is reluctant to allow his hero any flaws, even fear and despair, on his harrowing journey.  a fascinating and sensitive examination of jewish-nazi collaboration, generational amnesia and the delicate construction of the thing we call history.  on top of its historical significance, crazy rich asians is a great movie, period. i laughed, i cried, sometimes both at the same time. thanks jon m. chu and the phenomenal cast, it\\'s such a joyful experience that\\'s both funny and romantic.   rp1 may not be perfect, but it places spielberg back at his best.  fails to provide enough action and story that doesn\\'t shy itself away from falling to the tropes of a generic summer blockbuster.  some early sequences seem a tad uncertain, but a little way in all becomes surer of itself and, for now going on eighty years ago, a miracle.  the central problem of the movie is one of redundancy.  novel never quite dazzles despite its big-name cast, elaborate costumes, and loads of glitter  a young woman is trapped and terrorized in the isolated summer house her father and uncle are preparing for sale in this derivative thriller whose big twist horror fans will figure out long before it arrives.  director by j.d. dillard brings this under-the-radar drama close to genre cliches but deftly avoids them with his strong characters, fine storytelling, and vivid atmosphere.   how can a teen romantic fantasy not be at least some fun when the leading man\\'s lipstick is several shades redder than that of the ingénue?  impressively, \"gangs of wasseypur\" manages its sprawling story lines deftly and maintains a brisk pace throughout its daunting length.  surprisingly i came out of soul surfer without that sticky sweet feeling you get from too much schmaltz and only a strong desire to see annasophia robb in more moves and carrie underwood in far fewer.  a squall of improbabilities leads to a laughable late revelation, yet somehow the film keeps a clammy grip.  a great exercise in low budget filmmaking but not much of a monster movie.  capitalism\\'s aim is too scattershot. it\\'s old hat for moore to argue only one side of the story, but this is the first time he has so blatantly failed to focus on the issue at hand  it is an astonishing, vivid portrait not only of a time and place, but of an era\\'s spirit.  you never regret that nicole kidman ended up being the actress who got this made.  ...everything i liked about the original movie has been worn down.   eden\\'s formless and lackadaisical narrative perfectly captures the feel of the \\'90s french house era, both its rise and inevitable fall from grace.  while masterson\\'s script might come up a hair short, lumet remains firmly in control: even at 83, there\\'s nothing arthritic about his ability to engage our emotions or our intellect.  like most episodic tales, some episodes are better than others; but even the good ones aren\\'t as fully developed as they might be.  in america gets better after a muddled start.  ...its [a] sincere and loving reproduction of a tradition full of nuances. [full review in spanish]   like disney in a minor key, the film\\'s focus is on the true nature of family.  a tragically atrocious roadblock in the momentum baumbach established with his previous movie, neither recapturing any of that magic nor paving any new ground.  as the title character, michael fassbender gets the sob part down just fine, but there\\'s little evidence of the personal magnetism that enabled jobs to bend so many people to his will.  ultimately, her movie is about how her life, anybody\\'s life, is created out of oddments that never quite cohere, and don\\'t need to. the sheer sensuousness of all these bric-a-brac memories is sustaining.  a portrait of a happy man.  hong distills vast emotional crises and creative self-recognitions into confessional monologues, pugnacious discussions, and luminous aphorisms.  [i]n the end it\\'s just another macho fantasy about \"good guys\" with guns.  there are a number of cheeky winks from the filmmakers specifically aimed at harryhausen fans; in the end, though, leterrier\\'s clash of the titans is nearly as messy an assemblage of mythic odds and ends as the original.  for every breath he\\'s grasping for, you\\'re holding one in, anticipating what might follow.  while you could name the contents of pride\\'s cluttered collection of culture clashes and personal revelations well before they are laid out, the emotional authenticity of the movie... will swiftly win you over without warning.  a lavish, sensual and endlessly fascinating film that almost fetishes fetishism, this is provocative in every sense.  the trick to red 2\\'s success is its willingness to allow the actors to roar through all their greatest hits at the loudest possible volume.  one of this year\\'s must-see films, this is not simply a worthy tribute of a subject too often ignored by hollywood; it\\'s also a remarkable piece of cinema in its own right.  can the modern man handle brisseau\\'s cup of tea? the answer: dude! all-girl threesome!  a horror thriller, a political satire, a dysfunctional family comedy, and a touching melodrama, bong joon-ho\\'s the host is also one helluva monster movie.  as the details mount, and the star does what stars do, it starts to seem like a good bag of potato chips. there\\'s no nutritional value, but darned if you don\\'t keep eating.  a big fall-off from the inspired zaniness of green\\'s \"pineapple express,\" \"your highness\" lowers the lowbrow bar.  it didn\\'t belong in theaters, but it\\'s amusing and enjoyable.  a dog faces death, not because of cold or hunger, not because it was abandoned to face the polar winter alone, but because it was distracted and enamored by the southern lights?  this is a beautifully-photographed movie. i mean it.  buoyant and lightweight... except for brando, who is, in fact, rather heavy.  like its main character, it really comes alive when it catches the waves.   the worst use of a skynrd song since karaoke night at hooters.  much of the time, watching beyond the black rainbow is accompanied by head scratching, but perhaps that\\'s the point of this trippy outing.  this saga of demonic possession deploys the full audio firepower of modern multiplexes, and does so with brain-battering frequency, like a ghostbusting version of a japanese taiko drum ensemble.  ... the type of film that makes you wish time travel was real just so you could go back and experience it for the first time again  through hollywood contrivance, it stretches interest long enough to make it to the final goal of sport spirit.  there are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.  one of the best films i\\'ve seen about the ways in which grief can pull a person in both directions simultaneously.  hbo knows how to produce a compelling biographical movie...   there\\'s only a moderate level of humor and suspense in this formulaic caper comedy that seems to borrow from a few genre predecessors.  a potent glimpse of doom with a jarringly familiar ring.  how many times have we seen the components of this plot? the crimes of the young; the trials of the old; the lone individual fighting for truth and decency. but they were never mixed like this before.  not only is this a strong early contender for worst film of the year, it could well be a candidate for the worst film ever made.  monstrously bad...sommers not only plunders the classic films for material but trashes what he\\'s cribbed from them.  easy to mock, but hard to truly dislike  following a twelve-year patent dispute regarding the invention of the intermittent windshield-wiper motor, it\\'s not as interesting as it sounds.  21 and over is pretty much for people with an iq of 21 and under.  \"retired & extremely dangerous\" this lot may well be, but after two films proving they can\\'t get it together, the emphasis really ought to be on retired.  daphne truly is a fascinating character study. emily beecham is astounding, portraying a layered and complex character, and one that we rarely see on screen.  michelle pfeiffer is quite good, but the script leaves kathy bates -- talented as she is -- with a bit of a cartoonish performance.  smug, artificial, ill-constructed and fatally overlong...it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite, degenerating into a pious, preachy soap opera.  casa de los babys isn\\'t a perfect film. it ultimately seems brief and leaves too much of the women\\'s (and children\\'s) fates to our imagination...  a restrained, world-weary impression of the various american attempts (from torture, interrogation, surveillance, and the final hi-tech marine raid) to track down bin laden.  a leaden adaptation of zola\\'s 19th century story of guilt and betrayal  sometimes unknown\\'s tongue is so firmly in cheek that the audience doesn\\'t even realize there\\'s a joke happening.  frank ... keeps things tense enough that we may not have time to notice one or two failings in the script.  some movies just deserve to be tucked away into obscurity. this is one of those movies.  a thoroughly delightful documentary celebrating ireland\\'s wonderfully unique old pubs, the marvellous characters who run and patronise them, and the roles they\\'ve played in irish life down the centuries.   digs deep into the subject of piracy, arguing that it\\'s less an anachronism than a sign of the times.  filmmaker cameron crowe can\\'t catch a break with aloha, a hawaii-set romcom that is a handful of stories struggling for a unifying tone, but is nowhere near as toxic as its advance buzz.   it\\'s all pretty dizzying to process on first viewing, even more difficult to extricate from the incredible legend and circumstance that surrounds its existence.   there\\'s a witty sense of humor at work here -- that turns wicked in the third act -- much of it at the expense of literary pretension and both the egotism and insecurity that lead to ill-advised sexual dalliances.  if you\\'re looking for women in feathered boas doing high kicks to an assortment of vintage sounding musical numbers then nine delivers. so do the rockettes.  it shouldn\\'t be viewed as the wedding crashers 2, as that will only raise expectations and create disappointment. but it works as a different, mainstream comedy.  for the first 15 minutes or so cars 3 seems like a dash-for-the-cash affair. then disney does what they do best: they get viewers emotionally involved with the characters.  but despite all of bay\\'s best efforts, he still managed, through sheer dumb luck, to wind up with a cracking good sci-fi adventure that doesn\\'t falter until the second half.  the history boys is much less about lighting and composition than it is about bennett\\'s sharp, insightful script.  on balance, i recommend the movie both for nicholson\\'s performance and for the opportunity to spend some time with the kind of man that we often meet in real life, but rarely see on screen.  if you opt to rent the 3-d glasses, men in black 3 will be $14; the product has not, otherwise, changed significantly.  desire and the flush of first love permeate this haunting film, whose italian countryside setting echoes the beauty of the sentiments portrayed.  in a film which features flash floods, it\\'s the love story that becomes the disaster. kedarnath, is indeed a calamity.  a politically charged, love-it-or-hate-it, speculative-fiction fantasy that ruthlessly skewers and satirizes the modern age while also being darkly absurdist and brutally funny.  but this being a [lynne] ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it\\'s grim, far-reaching effects.   whether or not this is the best film marvel studios has made to date-and it is clearly in the discussion-it is by far the most thought-provoking.   wish upon\\'s shoddy humanism just withers the soul and chips away at good taste.  hawking emerges from this as an inspirational man; with such a colossus, finnigan could have afforded to be more questioning.  the movie looks and sounds like a real film, not an extended version of the tv show. the acting and the cinematography is bumped up a notch.  all [director] alexander proves in punisher: war movie is that a martial-arts-trained woman can make a film just as stupid, coarse and numbing as any muscle man.  white noise\\'s scares mostly wind up lost in transmission.  when it\\'s skarsgård, you buy the hangdog. with neeson, he\\'s always just one affront away from killing everybody.   it\\'s like one of ingrid bergman\\'s screwier films, or a john hughes breakfast club-like setup if you\\'re into more contemporary references.  the film is incredibly quotable and full of memorable moments, making for a script that never stops delivering.  this is the conundrum of power rangers: the closer it gets to fantasy spectacle, the less imaginative it becomes.  a slick mishmash of exotica, minutia, and airbrushed platitudes (a lot of babies are born, but how can that be if no one has sex?) that tries to sum up the lives of everybody.  takes a blandly nonpartisan approach to one of the most controversial, as well as influential, politicians in british history.  the matrix revolutions is not a bad movie. it\\'s just a maddening one.  most of submergence feels curiously flat, given the frustration that the characters go through once they are separated.  coasts mainly on surfaces. issues and questions are raised, grazed, but remain unexplored.   worthington is so wooden it\\'s a wonder rubbing up against mendes doesn\\'t cause him to spontaneously combust.   with the exception of bardem\\'s hilarity, fassbender\\'s plumbing the depths of great grief, and pitt and rubén blade\\'s gangster poetics, the word for the film overall is \\'meh.\\'  there\\'s no pay off, no scares, no original plot elements, but a ton of melodrama worthy of a tv movie of the week.  hitman: agent 47 does deliver sleek production values and a stand-out performance from hannah ware... other than that, it\\'s a nonsensical story that feels as if it was written by a 10-year-old who plays too many video games.  its craft is evident, its sincerity is admirable, and it\\'s the kind of movie about which you can say, \"there\\'s not a hair out of place,\" and mean it.  in the age of shopping-centre cinema, christopher nolan builds cathedrals.  step up may sizzle on the dance floor, but when the dancing stops, the film fizzles.  as they navigate the chaos, the film mostly sidesteps genre clichés, managing some genuine emotional resonance amid the inevitable blood and gore.   complementing films from bonnie and clyde to pulp fiction, out of sight delivers original material in a stylish manner.  though the film ... has been described by some critics as \\'almodovar-esque,\\' actor-turned-director baltasar kormakur\\'s sensibility is far less outrageous.  a thoroughly entertaining and fun adventure that delivers exactly what is expected from a movie called \\'clash of the titans,\\' nothing more or less.  \"the great invisible,\" margaret brown\\'s quietly infuriating documentary film about the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill, includes depressing information that many would probably be happier not knowing.  an ungainly hybrid of low-key drama and tawdry thriller, the martha\\'s vineyard-set indie \"off season\" squanders some inviting local color on a blah horror/mystery plot.  cuarón has produced a work that\\'s as reductive as it is offensive.  ... ultimately akin to a never-ending cutscene from a game you\\'re never allowed to play.  characters appear to be working out their thoughts as they speak, rather than reciting something they\\'ve already concluded.  we do see new york from some interestingly different angles and jack goes on a voyage which might inspire others like him.  this biopic serves as a good crash course on the explicit world of gangsta rap.  there\\'s no suave dork or sensitive jock. rather, the high-school kids act like high-school kids -- relentlessly immature and all the better for it.  crossbreed could have aired on the sci-fi channel in 1999 and felt right at home and i mean that in the best possible way.   oldboy is too violent and strange for mass audiences, while the select few who\\'ve seen park\\'s film will recognize lee\\'s work as a beat-for-beat remake that adds almost nothing new while building to the same climax.  a will ferrell cinematic playground. sit back and enjoy.  a welcome diversion from dreamworks animation\\'s increasingly trying shrek series.  there is such a thing as binge pessimism. it happens when one living disaster area, considered insufficient in a story, is served up with several others, causing audience braincells to swirl, stagger and collide against thalamic lampposts.  it\\'s a so-so, unnecessary remake.  it is a bold work that could come only from a strong trust and faith forged over time between the three collaborators.  kidnapping, larceny and murder have seldom been funnier than in fargo.  no, it\\'s not easy to watch, but it\\'s darkly riveting.  in the accountant, blatancy overtakes sincerity...absurdly convoluted, this film stays blatantly politically correct.  the destination is a pageant that will demonstrate, in grotesque, stomach-churning detail, that beauty is skin-deep and that you don\\'t have to win to be a winner.  war. what is it good for? imax 3d movies that wallow in the spectacle of horrific real-life battles, judging by stalingrad.  cheadle isn\\'t always successful, but his efforts work out more often than not. and i\\'d rather see an ambitious film occasionally fall short than a by-the-numbers biography, something this movie avoids at all costs.  [mulloy] brings a documentarian\\'s objective eye to \"una noche,\" yet the actors - non-professionals - convey exactly the emotions she is looking for.  covenant doesn\\'t look to offer much of the same experience first undertaken in scott\\'s \\'79 science fiction-horror, but what we get instead is hardly lacking in brains or guts... and i mean that both figuratively and otherwise.  intersecting the friction of a taut thriller and the biting wit of a dark comedy, cory finley proves he has the eye and the talent.  some movies just don\\'t stand the test of time.  \"dream boat\" includes plenty of buff bodies but milewski has more serious topics in mind, and that is why his wistful doc resonates.   the movie works as a silly parade of ridiculous but fascinating action sequences, but flops as political fiction or coherent melodrama.   the shallow frat-on-frat rivalry and the poor-boy-loves-rich-girl subplot don\\'t mean a thing. but the stepping does got that swing.  i\\'m placing all of the blame on the script and filmmaking, but that\\'s because the actors can only do so much with what they\\'re given.   more of a thoughtful meditation than a narrative feature, this meandering turkish odyssey is packed with profound issues rather than well-defined characters or plot.  exciting, provocative genre cinema.  if devastation porn is your cup of tea, this is the picture for you. that\\'s all it has to offer-just monster-on-monster, building-bashing action like you haven\\'t seen since maybe last week.   whether you\\'re acquainted with the king novel or 90s movie, or new to the it mythology, this new version will leave you breathless - and probably sleepless, too.  on one hand, madame de . . . is all surface and style; on the other, it conveys real loss.  you can expect to see this heartwarming documentary debut on the [netflix] later this year.  under the silver lake never finds a reason for being as weird as it is, making for a confusing and frustrating experience despite its hypnotic visuals and great score.  star wars take heed, there is a disturbance in the force, and it has bad teeth.  [bavo defurne] lacks the mordacity and inventiveness to live up to [the film\\'s] ambitious purpose. [full review in spanish]   surfwise will make you hug your parents a little harder the next time you see them.  while there are shades of neeson\\'s avenging angel in the taken franchise, this is a different, more challenging proposition for the actor.  the fight sequences are slick, but this is a soulless slog.  \\'magic mike\\' might be an exploitation picture, sure, but in the way \\'two-lane blacktop\\' delights car enthusiasts or \\'fat city\\' is for boxing fans.  portrays the ravages of [alzheimer\\'s] with clear-eyed honesty, tracking not only the effects on its victims but also on the caretakers who provide support even as their loved ones are fading away right before their eyes.  conjures a future out of painfully unconvincing special effects.  there is something quite extraordinary about richard linklater\\'s film as it depicts a fictional representation about growing up, family, relationships and life\\'s choices - using real time as its bookmark and calling card.  fans of the novels will eat it up, while newbies may wonder what all the fuss is about.  the nicest thing that you can say about it is that it isn\\'t quite as contemptuous of its audience as the incredibly lazy and unnecessary \"saw v\" was.  \"the conjuring 2\" satisfies more than it disappoints.  there\\'s almost a funny bromance comedy lurking somewhere in \"the change-up\" but it never emerges.   washington\\'s usual irrepressible charm and intelligence are smothered.  a silly and serious work of art that isn\\'t afraid to entertain.  ...condenses the familiarity of so many other party-hearty romps into 93 harried minutes.  bad words is clearly jockeying to be another bad santa, but because it frequently pulls back from going too far, it lacks that picture\\'s killer instinct.  ... it\\'s only a movie -- one the australian tourism commission probably doesn\\'t want you to see.  an uneven, heavy-handed blend of darkly comic satire, drama and magical realism saved by strong performances and an ambiguous ending that leaves enough room for interpretation.   shetty\\'s need to maintain his characters\\' romantic heroism constantly grates against his depictions of their ridiculousness.  it\\'s a silly plot, with even sillier skits sprinkled throughout, but zoolander is great fun.  what a wasted chance at, ahem, a bouncy start of the summer movie season.  cheap laughs, cheap stunts, cheap characters and with absolutely nothing important to say.  ...doesn\\'t have the emotional involvement of the best of sci-fi action films, but it\\'s a thrashing good big dipper ride and the 3d actually works  i would be amazed to hear even the most ardent sparks fan defend it as anything more than rubbish.  i assume cranston\\'s oscar nomination was in recognition of not dying of shame when he\\'s obliged to explain communism to his daughter during a scene lit and staged like an ad for chlamydia medication.  the filmmaker and his work deserve to be better known, and pig is an ideal introduction to both for american audiences.  what follows is a blast of an action movie that still manages to be funny, touching, and has one of the best ending lines of any movie ever. really.  one of the funniest and most quotable films likely to hit cinemas this year.  the film is absent of humor and thrills, and accented with designs and color schemes that are equally notable for their lack of risk.  \\'sinister\\' director scott derrickson again delivers the (modest) goods in this old-school street-cop mystery-thriller in \\'exorcist\\' drag.  eventually, blade loses its edge.  but the music is swell (and swells), and the actors win you over, even if this is no \"les choristes\" (2004).  after years of being playfully assaulted by six, this time he\\'s delivered something that\\'s 100% boring.  taraji p. henson comes out swinging in this female-centric update of the 2000 mel gibson rom-com \\'what women want,\\' but the cliché-ridden film can\\'t go the distance  almost nothing of insight is allowed to intrude on the story, the single point of curiosity being the mild tension between the editor and her flame-haired, forthright creative director grace coddington.  the amount of lens flares in this movie is awe inspiring.  performance is a challenging and thought provoking film, its greatest assets being its four outstanding performances  a dark and thrillingly horrible adventure into the realms of the unthinkable.  though there\\'s nothing actively offensive about the execution of storks, there\\'s simply nothing compelling about it, either.  this is filmmaking at its very best and rarely does a film grip with such intensity, some scenes being almost unbearable to watch as the situations the men find themselves in create palpable tension, which you believe utterly.  ... a push-me-pull-you kind of affair, which somehow chews up almost two and a half hours of screen time in total.  it\\'s one of the weirdest movies i\\'ve ever seen, and not in a particularly good way.  an unintentionally hilarious example of biopic gone wrong.  slender man essentially feels like a movie created from a how-to guide to horror. step one: apply drab color palette with hazy blues, greens, and neutrals. step 2: make sure all set pieces look like generic, creepy locations.  its subjects blandly keep your attention in almost the exact same way that reality-show contestants keep your attention.  it may sound bleak, but there is such life and compassion in every frame that the film\\'s tune turns to a song of love.  there\\'s no doubt polanski is a major artist, and his fans will probably get a lot out of his recollections, but don\\'t expect any rigorous attention to the ethics of documentary-making. this is a personal exercise in public atonement.  a vacuous excuse for a film that\\'s as frustrating as summer blockbusters get.  if you\\'ve ever wished that a really good action director -- john woo, say -- would make a james bond film, you can stop wishing.  . . .demon shares another common horror film problem -- it doesn\\'t satisfactorily resolve the chaos it has indulged.  this really is a movie full of gags. and not entirely in a good way.  a tedious, impenetrable cat-and-mouse game involving russian double and triple agents.  the weakest of the eight best picture oscar nominees, this nevertheless turns out to be one of the better clint eastwood releases of recent vintage, even if it\\'s less a heartfelt piece of moviemaking and more a bald lunge to score yet more academy gold.  no samurai armour; no suicide garden; not much really of fleming\\'s bizarre, obsessive travelogue.  too much explicit sex, drugs and profanity  heartfelt but rather generic.  forster successfully navigates small-town american gothic terrain, brilliantly detailing not only the association between grief and self-destruction, but also grief\\'s capacity to engineer profound redemption.  the family\\'s vulnerabilities and eccentricities burrow under the skin.  it is lifeless, in other words, and quite the slog, with jerky pacing, such an abundance of bearded men you lose track of which bearded man is which, and it reduces two of history\\'s most fascinating women to not much of anything.  [parker and stone\\'s] merciless mockery of hollywood action clichés, particularly those found in jerry bruckheimer\\'s productions, couldn\\'t be more accurate.  a real shocker, it chills the heart.  that director zack snyder\\'s vehemently faithful adaptation of alan moore\\'s seminal graphic novel is as entertaining as it is counts as a monumental achievement. but that doesn\\'t make it a great movie.  a sappily-ever-after fairy tale.  under no circumstances would i recommend that you see \"white irish drinkers.\" but if you do, a good, stiff belt would not be a bad idea.  foster is so good, and the plight of an ordinary person destroyed by violence so compelling, that the movie is likely to be a hit.  why does this movie feel so tentative, so conflicted?  widely imitated but never surpassed.  a genuinely hilarious teen comedy with a fantastic script and wonderful comic performances from its three leads.  it feeds the warrior fantasies of adolescent boys with a testosterone-heavy tale of a war free of moral complications.  ken loach\\'s breezy scribble about lowlife redemption and drunken buffoonery isn\\'t so much heavy-handed as it is charmingly weightless.  eternally heavy-handed director abel ferrara isn\\'t interested in making anything that even remotely resembles a conventional horror film.  uma ótima releitura da série de tevê, o filme traz carell em momento inspiradíssimo.  in its sequel, the jokes, if you can call them that, are trying way too hard.  \"contraband\" involves a lot of energy, but i\\'m getting tired of violent retreads of these heist elements.  this holiday season leave the emotional manipulation to the professionals (read: your family) and avoid \"love the coopers\" at all costs.  there\\'s a terrifying moment in al pacino\\'s new movie.  this movie achieved the unusual - made me laugh out loud - not once, but several times.  it\\'s probably a stretch to surmise that, just as the first film\\'s subtext dealt with health fears, the sequel mines its dread from the horror of malpractice.  simultaneously educates and inspires...  an arresting true story and a ravishing visual creation, but the two remain separate entities that do not support one another but get in each other\\'s way instead.  it sounds the kind of story that should fire the blood and excite great passion but it is workmanlike and too worthy for its own good.  good performances, but it\\'s difficult to give two hoots about close\\'s passion project when the story remains as pinched and hermetic as poor little albert nobbs himself.  with each film in the transformer saga, michael bay makes it clear that all he\\'s interested in are massive metallic special effects bashing into each other and usually exploding.   it\\'s an interesting look at an often glossed-over aspect of the subculture - although the doc sags as it progresses into the mid-1990s and current modes of fashion.  for all the acting excellence on display in nocturnal animals, what mattered more was cracking the narrative rubik\\'s cube invented by wright and elevated by ford\\'s precise integration of style and substance.  not many actors can get away with switching in and out of character, and yet willis does it with ease, confident in our love. and we do love willis.  quale and his crew clearly want this to be a good old-fashioned two-fisted caper, but the pacing is leaden and the plot lacks imagination. worst of all, nobody really bothered to give the picture an angle. it\\'s all straight, flat and dull.  cliché-ridden, stereotype-stuffed and clunky at every inevitably false turn, it\\'s so bad that star hugh grant, usually the most relaxed of actors, actually seems to be in pain throughout the film.  watching due date is kind of like taking a really lengthy car trip. every so often, you see something awesome, but then there are long stretches of monotony in between.   guaranteed non-stop, gung-ho action plugged directly into your synapses.  one for the money is tepidly glib throughout. even violent murders are followed by wisecracks or another prurient opportunity to ogle heigl\\'s behind and cleavage.  it\\'s a sweet, low-key charmer.  [pootie\\'s] nonsense vocab eventually loses the power to impress.  this mirthless eddie murphy vehicle from the director of \\'driving miss daisy\\' is rife with hoary \\'magical negro\\' stereotypes.  it\\'s presumably a labour of love, yet it doesn\\'t give you any sense of a personality or imagination behind the camera.  despite its true-events pedigree, \"kidnapping mr. heineken\" is woefully captive to b-movie crime saga tropes.  the sum of the parts of this film while tantalizing and worth a watch, leave the viewer, like its lead character, lacking closure.  anderson\\'s films often bounce between absurd comedy and poignant catharsis, and mr. fox is no different. its brisk pacing keeps the catharsis from weighing down the comedy.  osmosis jones is one of the most daring and original major hollywood movies in a long time.  alice englert and alden ehrenreich give performances that make this thing worth seeing. given that the story is preposterous, it\\'s entertaining enough to keep you awake most of the time.  a touching story about a mad and sad blocked writer in the midst of a midlife breakdown.  without youtube\\'s david blaine vid there wouldn\\'t be a \\'burt wonderstone\\' ... you don\\'t have to be a houdini to escape this enthusiastically tasteless comedy. just put one foot in front of the other ...  i didn\\'t want either of the two guys to earn her affections. they\\'re both superficial jerks - an opinion that didn\\'t change throughout the entire film.  the characters here exist for the plot, and the plot exists for swooning sensuality, adorable romance, and warm feelings about our shared humanity.  it\\'s light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness, and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing.  it\\'s one of the director\\'s most atmospheric, the shots of a wave-lashed cove and fog-choked headland making the town\\'s impending reckoning almost poetic.  viewers are left with nearly two hours of dull, rather obvious gags.  an infuriatingly-offensive, soft-porn primer on how to treat girls as objects who exist at the disposal of men.  following the lazy formula the director laid down in \"valentine\\'s day\" and \"new year\\'s eve,\" marshall and his writers line up a bunch of stars, set up some basic sitcom situations, then hope audiences are in the right holiday spirit.  mistakenly thinks a lot of profanity, ugliness and bloodshed [...] are, in and of themselves, enough to sustain a satire about showbiz ruthlessness.  the film was crude and the comedy was outlandish more than it was funny.  step up plods along as if feeding coins into a cliché meter.  occasionally preachy and oversimplified, yet captivating, tender and heartfelt. it can lead to many interesting discussions if you open your mind and heart to it, and forgive its preachiness. karen abercrombie gives an emotionally radiant performance.  an odd but not unappealing mixture of mystical road movie and family psychodrama.  art helps man cope with trauma in fact-based drama.   mostly it\\'s a quiet salute to classic romantic comedy - and to a star who, frankly, is far nicer than the times he was born to work in.  a fun feminist spy comedy with wonderfully outlandish events and fascinating examinations of the genre.  bottom line: nice puppetry, crappy movie.  tsangari\\'s deadpan approach to the increasingly sociopathic behaviour of the sextet is perfectly judged.  coppola\\'s graceful, touching, father-daughter chamber piece feels like -- in the best sense -- a love letter to her father.   camp classic grindhouse gore.  the opening sequences of war on everyone are so furiously fast and funny it\\'s nearly unimaginable that mcdonagh can sustain the pace. and yet he does.  despite a hard rocking performance from tom cruise, rock of ages fails to tap into that sex, drugs and sleazy rock \\'n\\' roll spirit of the 1980s with director adam shankman confusing glam with camp.  a film unlike any other this year.  between the thrilling concert footage, what emerges is a pungent time capsule of a forgotten fringe of america, ripe for rediscovery.  teen sitcom-level dialogue, wooden acting, snogging-in-the-rain flashbacks and ludicrously chrome-plated alien racecars.  by no means a perfect film, but carpenter has an unparalleled gift for constructing a sequence.  the pace drags, the stunt double work is obvious and the slapstick, especially a ski-hill scene, is contrived and extended.  yet the crushing disappointment of the film (which matches archive footage with contemporary reflections) is that nothing really happens.   army of shadows is a remarkable and superb film, and american audiences should be rejoicing that is finally (if belatedly) has reached theaters.  it strictly remains more \"trick\" than \"treat.\"  in terms of plotting, birds of passage won\\'t surprise...but you\\'ve never seen this story through this lens before.  the action is so relentless that even hard-core martial-arts fans might need to pause for breath. and much of it is so repetitive that the film occasionally plays like a rerun of itself.  a drama which starts off as a playful comedy only to knock you sideways with its emotional depths.  the lodgers is an almost pornographically gothic movie. if you adore this sort of stuff -- and i most certainly do -- you\\'ll eat every inch of it.  the only truly scary thing about this film is that it runs out of narrative steam with 30 or 40 interminable minutes still to go.  [jack ryan] offers up some formulaic yet fun thrills and is essentially the best you\\'re going to get as far as january flicks go.  this movie is dedicated to a monster that already proved to be inherently frightening, but in spite of a couple of good scares ... it never quite gets to where it [should be].  song of the sea is an impressive feat of animation, made all the more enjoyable by the fact that it\\'s not trying to sell anything.  baumbach is particularly adept at finding the humour in what could\\'ve been tragically sad situations. for all of his characters\\' flaws, baumbach is generous, never playing them for caricatures even though it would\\'ve been all too easy.  the many plot strands the script tries to weave together get so horrifically tangled they choke the humor out of any given situation.  bone tomahawk is a major disappointment.  this is dinosaur stuff. a rubber chicken and a squirting flower would\\'ve really capped things off.  vacillates between laughless humor and cheap social commentary.  the humanity, driven by remarkably honest performances from negga and edgerton, shines through  the movie\\'s not bad enough to be world-ending, merely clumsy enough to make the offending studio exec clean out his desk.  chadwick boseman is so formidable that, were the film itself just a bit better, he would eventually be basking in the same sort of year-end accolades that greeted jamie foxx as ray charles and joaquin phoenix as johnny cash. who knows, he may yet.  could also have lost half an hour yet still maintained the momentum towards a powerful climax...  the result is something that might best be called monty python and the holy mess.  the movie is completely tone deaf - unsure if it\\'s a horror movie, a comedy or a drama - and never finds anything interesting in the characters for the audience to latch on to.  while watching bowling for columbine, the word \\'absurd\\' kept coming to mind.  [deadpool 2] has just the right balance of coarseness and political incorrectness.   all surface, no thought and quite horribly empty.  a bit of a slog when it dismisses dramatic momentum. it\\'s certainly a very handsome creation, but there\\'s little there beyond surface appeal.  the impact of barry levinson\\'s eco-apocalyptic nail-biter is undeniable, especially when you realize some of it is based on fact.  about 20 times less cool than it should be.  a mixed bag of blood, action, and terrible jokes.   polar is an ultraviolent action flick with graphic torture, plenty of nudity and even a fair amount of hard drug use thrown in for good measure. but it\\'s not nearly as fun as all that sounds.  in six words, cradle 2 the grave is hackneyed, preposterous, disposable, undemanding, diverting, and energetic.  an irrepressibly bawdy, sometimes hilarious comedy ...  ms. hanna and her message of empowerment are disappointingly translated very nearly into a cult of personality in this film\\'s idolizing portrayal.  unfortunately, about halfway through, the film takes a (deliberate) nosedive into the depths of human degradation from which it never emerges.  when getting into the nitty-gritty of tapes and tracks, grohl makes a strong case for music docs directed by musicians.  every once in a while cage will team up with a visionary director who knows how to channel that relentless energy into something profound... director panos cosmatos does just that.   the yule log was way more entertaining.  everything it was cracked down to be.  it\\'s passable entertainment that our culture has wildly overrated.  \"gloria bell\" wavers between realistic drama and tender comedy, which makes for an uneven but never uninteresting mix.  delivers a full-bodied, genuinely humorous account of ambiguity and austerity.   it\\'s an accomplished and intriguing work that marks jung out as a talent to watch.  considering its true-life source material, the film\\'s structure mutes its suspense with intermittently compelling flashbacks.  it\\'s a mess of uncertain purpose, jarring tonal shifts, and melodramatic gimmickry.  though malkovich does a nice job in establishing the look and feel of this country, his lack of restraint in trimming the story\\'s excesses is what ultimately turns the film into an overlong bore.  with humor and irreverence, larraín draws his own neruda in this provocative and baroque film. [full review in spanish]  a lazy, by-the-numbers vehicle.  we expect better than this from the scripter of 87 episodes of \"mad men.\"  stylistically strange, sluggish and ultimately unsatisfying domestic drama.  there\\'s a good twist, the young leads are appealing and anyone who enjoys sparks\\' sincere storytelling will enjoy it, even though it\\'s overlong.  nobody does it like brooks! the best interpretation of the tale to date.  speaks powerfully to audiences with its potent blend of extraordinary performances and engaging soundtrack.  what could seem an empty stylistic exercise (and was, in the director\\'s 2002 full frontal) serves to bring a fresh urgency to the tale, ultimately granting the audience a wisdom and perspective the characters never possess.  this is truly a show about a more innocent time. makes you want to believe in magic all over again.  the movie might have resonated more if it threw out some of the grief-counseling cliches and let the idiosyncrasies of the characters dictate more of the drama.  here\\'s a thanksgiving turkey that was rancid as soon as the idea was cooked up.  the informant! says that people who do good or ill have complex motives for their actions, and that not everyone is knowable, instantly or ever.  the skill of the execution is notable throughout; it truly is horribly beautiful. best of all, in this virtual two-hander, its leads pitch their performances impeccably.  people who haven\\'t seen the original will love it, and people who have seen the original should at least like it.  sputore manages to express an age-old existentialist conflict concerning artificial intelligence on the backs of three performances.   high-rise is probably easier to like if you haven\\'t read j.g. ballard\\'s novel: you won\\'t know it\\'s missing 95% of his ideas.  taika waititi has found a way to balance his offbeat sensibility with a maturing humanity.  as a nature doc, more than honey rivals such acclaimed forebears as winged migration and microcosmos, though it\\'s working with a more limited scope, visually-if you\\'ve seen one honeybee, you\\'ve seen \\'em all.  it\\'s not a film i have a lot of affection for and it\\'s not one i\\'m eager to see again, but i appreciate the skill with which the movie was made.  \"mirror mirror\\'\\' is just a limp, jokey family film that wants to have its fairy tale magic and its hip irony, too.  ...sublimely goofy  frenetic, raucous, exhilarating fable about finding your place in a group.  i usually love payne, but his bloated downsizing (all 135 minutes of it) needs trimming all around.   ...a strange and sometimes discomfiting movie that occasionally gets a little heavy-handed as it traces the trajectories of two disrupted souls through the depressingly neutral territory of an airport hotel.   the film, at its core, is about being bullied & standing up to bullies and claiming one\\'s community. some nice sentiments, but so much of it is lost amidst the rampant, third-grade level stabs at humor.(full content review for parents also available)  basically, this is a little over half an hour of good action scenes framed by two hours of narrative nonsense.  if you\\'re looking for a terrific docudrama, you\\'re going to be very, very disappointed. total cookie-cutter and only meryl streep\\'s performance holds it together.  you\\'ll laugh, you\\'ll cry, you\\'ll feel like a kid again, and your kids will become a new generation to know these beloved characters.  it\\'s a brutal, wonderful performance, bolstered by the screenplay, which donoghue adapted herself. clever, nimble, and smart, it gives these actors room to truly work, all of which is supported by abrahamson\\'s sharp direction.  [director] villeneuve never strikes the moral terror that has distinguished his best films. . .blade runner\\'s awesomeness is gone.  faithful to the point of irrelevancy, richard linklater\\'s remake of \"bad news bears\" is an ok enough time passer, but given the talent involved, it should have been much, much better.  bodies and buildings blow up but this is carnage of the most lacklustre sort, with any momentum petering out long before it\\'s \"game over.\"  as well as being a terrific crime drama, all the money in the world also has the questionable distinction of being the first major film to entirely replace one of its stars after post-production.   it\\'s the feel-bad film of the year.  ...simply one of the best pictures of the year.  after watching paranormal activity, you might be inclined to sleep with the lights on for a week or four.  as relentlessly audacious and engrossing as anything within quentin tarantino\\'s flawless body of work...  first-time writer/director lisa nicol\\'s study of australian conductor michelle leonard and her moorambilla voices choir is one of the great documentaries in a year in which the form is curiously absent from cinemas.  the work of ingenious technicians who seem either not to know what gave the original film its magic, or not to care.  the word \\'lovely\\' comes to mind in assessing this intimate, character-driven piece about a man who tries to get away from people but finds to his luck that he cannot.  the issue of abortion will probably always be with us, one way or another, but for this particular battle in that ongoing war \"trapped\" is a powerful weapon.  having assembled a stellar cast (including the late seymour hoffman in his second to last role), slattery does a great job giving them an authentic blue collar neighborhood, but the characters who inhabit it don\\'t always make sense.  one might quibble with the cgi battle sequences ..., but that\\'s a small complaint. as long as [the film] concentrates on the scheming royals in their lush and lavish settings, it soars.  high class briefly gives way to high camp, which then itself dissipates to an anticlimactic thud.  it\\'s all a bit easy - though quite nicely performed - and knightley is never entirely convincing ...  a loosely tied-together string of pleasurable moments and frustrating \"what ifs?\"  taylor lautner tries to hold his own in an action thriller too silly to give him much of a chance.  it is what the classic ghostbusters was: a damn good time at the movies.  they missed the point, but stole the name / the real question today, is who to blame?  the plot and characters of pulpy revenge thriller dead man down are pure b-movie stuff, yet stars colin farrell and noomi rapace lend the film unexpected class and conviction.   little more than a genre exercise that rehashes a wealth of revenge-movie themes and tropes.  compelling and emotionally complex.  despite beautiful cinematography and juliette binoche in the title role, bruno dumont\\'s biopic is a dull fictionalized depiction of three days of the eponymous sculptor\\'s 30-year confinement.  uma ótima releitura da série de tevê, o filme traz carell em momento inspiradíssimo.  the results of the experiment don\\'t quite make all the tedium of construction worthwhile ... the pieces fit together, but the impact is fleeting at best.  pretty persuasion is so exploitative and misogynistic that its last-minute dramatic turns and pleas for tolerance and understanding come off as manipulative as its heroine.  a more entertaining, clever musical than its generic title suggests.   completely engrossing.  director ana lily amirpour\\'s allegorical future-shock cannibal drama is almost a masterpiece, with startling images and ideas.  in a year when women\\'s reproductive freedoms are constantly in the political crosshairs, what to expect when you\\'re expecting feels like just another affront to anyone who owns and operates a uterus.  a minimalist piece to be savoured like a good short story.  young, handsome and about the most amazing pugilist/stunt performer since the days of bruce lee and the pre-hollywoodized jackie chan, jaa electrifies an otherwise lifeless film.  fun ghost story, awesome monster, and jessica chastain dressed as joan jett. what more could you want?   unfortunately, all of the nice attributes in the world can\\'t make up for the script\\'s cynical betrayal of a classic coming-of-age parable.  with an ending so disturbing it just might rival the finale of \"oldboy,\" \"sleep tight\" doesn\\'t let its beauty get in the way of its bite, but it\\'s a film that nonetheless lifts horror to an artform.  robbie is impressive, but allison janney steals the movie as harding\\'s endlessly bitter and bullying mother.  there is so much gusto, such a willingness to go for broke and not look back [in the first act], that it seems too good to be true. as is often the case with such situations, it is.  juliet, naked doesn\\'t have much of value to say about contemporary relationships, at least nothing that hornby hasn\\'t already worked to death, but it\\'s generally good-humored.  a screenplay of cheats and unpleasantries, with director gluck looking to nudity from timberlake to keep the target demographic content, using gratuitous rear end shots to deflect attention away from a rotten motion picture.  jason statham preforms more implausible derring-do as a butt-stomping, daredevil driver for hire.  it\\'s impressive how the likes of winslet, spencer and watts can spout their required gobbledygook and still maintain conviction.  full of long stretches with no dialogue, giving the film a very high nod-off factor.  a former casting director, daniels shows undeniable savoir faire with his actors, a mix of musicians and comedians effectively cast against type.  king\\'s dark tower universe is rich with cultural reference points and is always totally unpredictable, but in cutting it down to consolidate its highlights, the dark tower can\\'t even shoot the most necessary bullets straight.  why this story? as it stands, it\\'s the story of a clean-cut kid who becomes an even nicer clean-cut kid.  although calendar girls is resolutely pleasant, the movie never really goes much beyond that.  the air trickles out of this sensitive but cliché-laced drama ...  frat-boy humor in every sense...a coarse and sloppy gross-out comedy made all the worse by the occasional moments that suggest it could have been something more.  boogie nights weaves a fascinating web of complex characters who are swept up in a tale of excess.  though the film remains entertaining for a little while...the film eventually becomes the same sort of typically dull farrelly brothers comedy most folks lap up willingly.  as with the first two american pie flicks, this is the kind of movie you see again 10 years later and wonder why you liked it back when you were young and dumb.  the lord of the rings. on coruscant. or discworld. cuz that\\'s what [branagh]\\'s done here, with a topping of wormholes and a sweetly old-fashioned side dish of richard donner\\'s superman...  much like as happened with punch drunk love, many audiences will find reason to be disappointed with this film, or at the very least confused. they won\\'t get why there\\'s no big finish, they won\\'t follow the nuances of the script. their bad.  the real story here is p. diddy, who owns this movie. at the end of the second act he explodes as a comic dynamo.  melinda returns woody allen to more steady ground; yet, his film still feels like a work completed with one eye closed.  carrie understands the natural desire of an audience to want to see revenge acted out on bullies, and is content to be what is essentially a superhero origin story.  \\'ever notice how guys are always walking around with their hands in their pockets, saying and expressing nothing? and women are always twirling and letting their emotions get the best of them?\\'  simultaneously offers priceless insight into the nation\\'s past and a worrisome take on the future.  just keeps charging forward, forcing you to stay plugged in and get charged up by what this energizing film has to offer.   forster skillfully captures the tone of a.a. milne\\'s characters and the subsequent productions drawn from the source material, making resistance to the film\\'s charms futile.  out-perversing gus van sant\\'s milk, soderbergh makes a four-hour-plus biopic about a historical figure without providing a glimmer of charm or narrative coherence.  while rise isn\\'t destined to be a new holiday classic...its a mostly well-crafted film with an excellent cast and a dizzying array of visual treats.  the movie is a real thrill ride, even if the plot is full of holes.  this colour saturated world of hokey pocus is truly intoxicating ... [but] i just haven\\'t fallen under the love witch\\'s spell  for all the desperation and tragedy, then, the film offers a kind of heroism, set against a frankly grim but also frequently poetic backdrop.  [writer-director azazel jacobs] clearly has an eye and an ear for the confused rhythms of human life.  a disastrous father-son endeavor about a calamitous father-son expedition, after earth doesn\\'t play to the strengths of any of its major participants.  inspiring docu advocates for legislation to help families.   um dos tipos de besteira mais irritantes que existem: aquele que acredita precisar de duas horas para ser contado.  i don\\'t think maggie gyllenhaal has ever been as radiantly sexy as she is here as a harried mother trying to cope with five kids...', ' manakamana doesn\\'t answer any questions, yet makes its point: nepal, like the rest of our planet, is a picturesque but far from peaceable kingdom.  wilfully offensive and powered by a chest-thumping machismo, but it\\'s good clean fun.  it would be difficult to imagine material more wrong for spade than lost & found.  despite the gusto its star brings to the role, it\\'s hard to ride shotgun on hector\\'s voyage of discovery.  if there was a good idea at the core of this film, it\\'s been buried in an unsightly pile of flatulence jokes, dog-related bad puns and a ridiculous serial arson plot.  gleeson goes the hallmark channel route, damaging an intermittently curious entry in the time travel subgenre.  it was the height of satire in 1976: dark as hell, but patently absurd and surely nowhere close to objective reality. objective reality surpassed it somewhere in the jerry springer era.  everyone in \"the comedian\" deserves a better movie than \"the comedian.\"  actor encourages grumpy christians to embrace the season.  slight, contained, but ineffably soulful.  bell\\'s debut feature addresses its subject with both humor and intelligence, approaching the issue of performance enhancement from every conceivable angle  ... except for its shamelessly (and irresistibly) zingy music score (by the director), halloween achieves its considerable power almost entirely through visual means.  this is not one for the uninitiated. it\\'s also not one for people who like action and thrills.  son of saul employs the formal mechanics of filmmaking to turn [its] ... questions back in on and around themselves, doing what cinema does best in the hands of great filmmakers: showing by not showing, telling by not telling.  it isn\\'t thrilling. fox can\\'t act. the backchat is more filthy than funny.  hiddleston and swinton are lovely to watch, but they need more to chew on than this.  yossi is a stronger film than its predecessor, more deeply felt and less reliant on love-story conventions.  i feel like a sparkle baby just puked rainbow-colored dust all over my head.   long, unfocused film.  kubo and the two strings is better than immersive -- it\\'s absorptive. we\\'re pulled in knight\\'s direction; we become part of his studio\\'s technical wizardry.  easy to enjoy, if you\\'re at all susceptible to this sort of thing, but it leaves you with nothing to think about, except for all the opportunities brooks missed to make something worthwhile out of the material.  an extraordinary blast from the past, x-men: first class will go down as one of this decade\\'s best superhero movies.  mostly lightweight, but the most interesting part of the movie is jamie foxx as electro. this villain embodies black rage, more malcolm x than mutant.  drawn, per a disclaimer, from period accounts of strange phenomena and psychotic breaks among settlers, eggers\\'s impeccably crafted, historically accurate creepshow wears its deep-dive research on its tattered gingham sleeves.  ... hones its dramatic elements to emotional effect rather than fall back on a slasher film template... moretz brings her a-game...  what seemed like a decent idea - a fourth and final stroll through the american pie gutter - is swamped by the reason why most of these actors haven\\'t worked much between sequels. they simply aren\\'t special, or even that good at what they\\'re doing.  free birds is unappealingly staged and paced with an uneven sluggishness. it begs the question: since things always seem to be happening, why is it all so crushingly dull?  a joyless, misanthropic 105 minutes worth of \"comedy\" that rates as coen brothers at their worst. how one can take such a marvelous period and turn it into a voyage into hell is an imponderable mystery to this critic.  this one, directed by john glen, just follows the numbers, plodding from one unimaginative set piece to the next.  the movie is purely visceral, generating adrenaline, alarm, and even tears. berg manages to avoid high-minded seriousness while still respecting the material.   peppermint could have been at least good trash, but it decides to be an awkwardly-paced exercise in shallowness. if you want a high body count, step right in, but brains behind the brawns are sorely missed.  while the hidden agenda that eventually surfaces does strain credibility, foster\\'s ability to reign in the improbable ... allows this flight to deliver the requisite thrills.  as a romantic comedy, this film has nothing new to offer except the rise of a new comedy star, awkwafina.   comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.  estevez means well. but having your heart in the right place is no excuse for insipid ineptitude.  ralston seems to love living his life on the ragged edge of disaster, and boyle\\'s filmmaking rides that same narrow edge, to breathtaking effect.  the film works fine as stand-alone entertainment, but does irreparable harm to the series as a whole.  it\\'s not that \"hangover ii\" is a notably bad movie. it\\'s more that nothing in it seems to justify all the effort spent to add a new but nearly identical series of episodes to the original.  you simply haven\\'t had this much fun at the multiplex in a long, long time.  amy sedaris suits up as everyone\\'s favorite former-prostitute/drug addict-turned-high school student in the long-awaited--and quite funny--big-screen version of the cult tv series.  we see unadorned faces staring at the camera; afternoon shadows moving across a large, institutional-looking building; forlorn images of an abandoned amusement park; the misty, magical quiet of a swamp.  throughout the documentary are gorgeous images of teenagers with goofy, full-of-hope smiles that make your heart ache.  a beautifully shot but aggressively menacing film that is at turns irresistibly sumptuous and hide-your-eyes-behind-your-hands disturbing.  the concept is much cooler than the execution.  both [gyllenhaal and ledger] embody what that old waylon and willie song taught us -- \\'cowboys ain\\'t easy to love, and they\\'re harder to hold.\\'  an unsubtle film for unsubtle times, all the better for not backing down with what it\\'s trying to say or how it says it.  one long, extensively choreographed fight sequence in which \"mortal\" blows are delivered so often, and with so little lasting impact, that a brawl just becomes a brawl becomes a brawl.  one of bergman\\'s undisputed masterpieces is a seminal work of psychonalayis and metacinema, raising more complex questions about identity and role-playing than it could possibly answer, thus deliberately encouraging ambivalence and ambiguity.  somehow that revolutionary, empowering message never got through to dunn. his film seems sexually and psychologically arrested in the pathology that blocks coming out.  ... a frothy girl-power manifesto so briskly paced, sharply written and infectiously entertaining that its deficiencies seem as insignificant as a lightly chipped fingernail.  it\\'s so disappointing for the director of rosemary\\'s baby to have to stoop to something as desperate as pyrotechnics and nudity.  the film is put together too choppily to appreciate the bounce-off-walls athleticism of parkour.  confirms the perception that only losers attend high-school reunions.  if younger truly wanted to work out some fantasies on the big screen, prime is the dullest, most unimaginative way he could\\'ve achieved that goal.  you can always expect a little embellishment for any horror film or thriller that claims to be based on a true story or actual events. this one, however, doesn\\'t sell it.  merely an excuse for the viewer to delight in the hilarity generated by mr. cable guy breaking wind, vomiting, producing various gastric noises, etc.  on its own, \\'enough said\\' is a sweet and charming little movie - but there\\'s no question the loss of its beloved leading man lends the picture extra, unexpected pathos.  the story might perhaps be adequate for an animated film for children, with thor, odin and the others played by piglets. in the arena of movies about comic book superheroes, it is a desolate vastation.  while short on fresh ideas, the film works thanks to some strong performances and a script that provides just enough depth to render its characters more than just a collection of eccentricities.  if you thought the oscar-winning 2004 drama crash was heavy-handed, just wait until you see crossing over.  as fresh as [gatlif\\'s] view of flamenco may be, his dramatic ideas are excruciatingly trite.  what a mountain of crap this movie is.  when [it] remembers that it\\'s supposed to be a sweet piece of hokum, when it has the wit to leave attenborough and wilson on the screen together and forget about its rash of putative improvements, it does offer well-scrubbed family fare.  the sex scenes are pretty hot, though their power is diminished by the characters\\' limited intelligence.  perfectly enjoyable but perfectly forgettable.  the general playful tone... helps a great deal, and the cinematography and editing are appealingly glossy and smooth throughout.  it is, despite spielberg\\'s claims, neither a purehearted popcorn flick nor a paul verhoevenesque subversion, but something uneasily in between, cowed by the idea of the fanboy demographic.  for all its political pelting, this is most gripping when it focuses on the innocent people whose lives have been destroyed either by the terrorists or by this administration.  we have the feeling that kemp/thompson saw much of life through the bottom of a dirty glass and did not experience it with any precision. the film duplicates this sensation, not with much success.  a reconstituted blend of ghostbusters meets men in black with a pinch of the x-files.  while it\\'s true that the problems of two little people don\\'t amount to more than a hill of beans in stalin\\'s ussr, they\\'re real enough to the people experiencing them. we feel for them, even if the world can\\'t.  a doublethink cash grab, painting perpetrator as saviour and exploited victims on the fringes of society as empowering role models - figures of inspiration to make mainstream, uncritical audiences feel better about themselves.  aire is a film about mother courage. [full review in spanish]  it might be best to let the big guy live happily ever after.  the film is so wadded full with ideas that they come squishing out the sides.  much of the heavy lifting falls to watson, and, in such moments as the one where she must wipe out her family\\'s memories of her to protect them, she is more than up to the task.  navel-gazing and listless, mary magdalene is nevertheless an affecting, contemplative hagiography of a biblical figure which is more inclined towards an arthouse aesthetic than anything in the \"faith-based\" sub-genre.  lawrence reunites with her \\'hunger games\\' director for a sadistic, sexed-up, russian spy saga that is one long \"nyet.\"   made almost 50 years ago, the black-and-white french classic still grabs you by the throat.  the actors, particularly seyfried and redgrave, help make the movie\\'s romantic spirit contagious.  while there are some nicely gory moments, the film feels rather uninspired ...  a handsomely photographed movie of little consequence.  damon is superbly silly in this comic version of a beautiful mind.  the film\\'s greatest mystery turns out to be: why, with so much talent, does dark water never cross the tipping point?  what hurts it is spielberg\\'s dogged insistence on turning it into yet another of his seemingly endless middle-brow meditations on the travails of the middle-class family.  krampus is a toothless film on several levels.  trite characters, very well-worn clichés of sf cinema, and a mystery that is completely transparent. all about production design, and even that is familiar.  another beautifully-made and serious-minded celebration of having nothing to say.  you\\'ll never hear the phrase \"mind the doors\" in the same way again.  it\\'s clear that these guys were just having some fun making a movie, and that fun they had translates onto screen perfectly.   despite being marketed as historical fiction king arthur story, this film is actually a high octane full on fantasy film that showcases excalibur guiding arthur to his destiny. and it\\'s thrilling!   the plot doesn\\'t hold up but the chemistry between the two leads does  a breezy hour-and-ten-minutes long, this beautifully affecting film is less about these beloved characters than its aging filmmaker\\'s wistful reminiscences of cinema itself and a long lifetime\\'s worth of material pleasures.  if we can operate at the genius level in a given field, does that mean we must -- even if the cost is the sort of endless purgatory a bobby fischer has inhabited? it\\'s an interesting question, and this movie doesn\\'t avoid it.  essential to maintaining the powerful atmospherics is the superb cast, which includes nicole kidman as the surgeon\\'s unsuspecting wife.  what grounds the spectacle, pushing it beyond a two-hour ejaculation of sensation, is its yearning for innocence  the performances are uniformly excellent.  the truth is that this film is mostly plain work, done by rote, like any introductory potions class. the real fun -- and thrills and tears -- come next year.  capturing that particular age group, of those in their late 20s and early 30s, entering into adulthood with a certain reluctance and trepidation.  ballard\\'s sumptuous images exist only to distract from his rather conventional failings of craftsmanship.  bring the spouse and live vicariously.   hickenlooper seems unsure what he wants his film to be. is it a mid-life crisis film? is it a marriage-in-trouble film? or is it really classy neo-porn lite?  kudos to cuaron for crafting such a visually-captivating, surreal memoir of his troubled coming of age!   crass, offensive, vulgar, inane: there aren\\'t enough adjectives to effectively convey the endless agony that is humshakals.  zootopia is filled with lovable characters and a heartfelt message for kids - along with a layered subtext for adults that is both timely and moving.   the grand statement it wants to make plays shallow instead of deep, leaving the film too weak-kneed to carry the weight of its broken world.  this is a wilder, bigger thing than just another farmyard sink drama. there may be little you haven\\'t seen elsewhere, but there\\'s no denying the skill here.  deliberate, uncompromising, and very sad, bob clark\\'s quiet masterpiece is still one of the most inspired anti-war genre pics out there.  this self-promoting hollywood film wants everyone to feel good about hollywood...  another empty, heavily voice-overed perfume commercial.  pity the crowds expecting another cute comedy like \"date night\" who wind up at \"crazy, stupid, love.\" it\\'ll be like asking for a burger and getting served escargot.  like mccarthy\\'s book, the road is dark, bleak and nightmarish but also stirring and beautiful and optimistic: as long as life remains, the movie argues, there is always hope.  just isn\\'t clever or surprising enough: it\\'s complicated but conventional, strikes no sparks...[and] fails to juggle its myriad tones successfully.  ... sharply observed, with an endearing quirky sense of humor and a genuine affection for its setting.  my mutant power (and the boxoffice tingle of $199 million in one week) tells me \"the last stand\" is anything but last. it\\'s not even likely to be penultimate.  whatever muse drives malick, whose best work feels both found - in the sense of discovered in the shoot and edit - and profound, he could be accused of cheating on her in knight of cups, leapfrogging between unsatisfactory short-term conquests.  an endearingly straightforward, intimate character study and one that remains wholly relatable.  mcdonagh has a way with a line that is without compare, and he has put together a cast who knows how to sock it home. harrelson is excellent with a character who also takes unexpected turns that we aren\\'t prepared for.  irons and patel create a bit of magic with their mathematical dance, so even when brown\\'s script bogs down in cliché and the female characters are swept into the corner of every scene, the viewer has something meaty to process.  an emotionally devastating documentary [...] falls apart toward the end when it loses all objectivity and descends into hagiography.  the easy charm of stars miles teller and analeigh tipton more than compensates for a screenplay that never quite bridges the divide between old-fashioned romance and the cruder tone that seems par for the course in modern comedy.  simply awful...like a syfy network saturday night special that\\'s inexplicably escaped to the big screen.  you need to give \"love is strange\" your eyes and ears and attention, let it work its effects on you gradually, like the lovely chopin piano music that forms the spine of its soundtrack.  a convoluted tale of corruption within the ranks of the police  a japanese film that draws out our respect and compassion for a man whose life is turned upside down by the early onset of alzheimer\\'s.  the worst film ever made in scotland ...  one can\\'t help but feel that the disney-depp partnership has taken the series as far as it can go in this form, and short of a large-scale overhaul of the franchise, it may be best to set these particular pirates adrift for good.  leaves behind almost as many derisive laughs as dead bodies.  the film moves at a snails pace and while it shows off a lot of beautiful scenery, it takes about 30 minutes for something to happen outside of the initial hubbaloo that sets charlotte off in the first place.  the nice way to put it is to say it\\'s the second best film of the franchise. it\\'s also accurate to say that it\\'s a pale imitation of the original that\\'s worse on every level.   yes, you\\'ve seen much of it before, and the nervous james character is now officially a cliché. but stewart makes you care anyway. this, folks, is an actress.  this isn\\'t a movie. it\\'s a broadway musical captured on film.  a genuinely moving exploration of a complex mother-daughter relationship  headstrong women might have been hard to find in turn-of-the-century europe, but heroines like tautou\\'s are a dime a dozen in costume dramas, and there isn\\'t enough material detailing what makes her chanel a special case.  when the finale of your movie involves a twenty-minute fantasy battle between role-playing enthusiasts, it is safe to say you have lost your way.  an intriguing erotic thriller undone by a silly, generic ending.  limp anthology has brief nudity, language, adult themes.   it may be slight, but it\\'s also very funny, occasionally insightful, and a welcome throwback to those hallowed school daze.  penelope cruz is outstanding in an otherwise lame male fantasy.  bold and innovative, spiritually challenging--and some heads get chopped off.  it\\'s a movie by dog lovers, for dog lovers, that\\'s more concerned with being cute and cuddly than providing any meaningful insight or substance.  not knowing whether to be a comedy or a drama and often failing at both, there\\'s very little to recommend about this downer of a movie.  a warm and fun crowd pleaser.  reeves y bullock no interpretan el papel de su vida, sin embargo cumplen con las expectativas del público en un producto ligero de fin de semana.  the wolf of wall street is a film that speaks to our times, and it is saying some very important things if we care to listen.  ridley scott\\'s not made his third sci-fi masterpiece, but boy, has he come close.  predictable romcom send-up has racy sex scenes, language.  in action, the film is breathtaking, but as a whole it suffers from a relative lack of ambition.  what in lesser hands could have become an immaculately observed period piece instead soars to creative heights with its literate and knowing script.  after the setup, the air leaks out of the movie, flattening its momentum with about an hour to go.  captain underpants: the first epic movie perfectly captures the

sequel to the most startling box-office smash of recent years collapses over the finishing line with barely a breath of air still in its lungs.  this document is a testament of the past, when things were done differently: the funny clothes, technical mishaps, av effects and the fortunate non-existence of smartphones blocking the experience. [full review in spanish]  the movie proud mary might not be anything special in itself, but its heroine sure as hell is.  if you take even the slightest interest in politics, book for the accidental prime minister now. it is a film that takes you through an important era in indian politics and is also entertaining.   an animated film that takes familiar disney archetypes and twists them into vivid, imaginative shapes.  one of those genre-defying hybrids that are sometimes called dramedies, the savages tiptoes along a particularly fraught emotional tightrope, balancing observant humor and deep sadness with uncommon grace.  the movie is eerily photographed, but never suspenseful or scary, and eventually, events descend into goat-sacrificing silliness.  details feel wrong; the pace is skittish; the rise to fatal hysteria is rapid and unconvincing. finally you just lose all faith in it.  this is one of those \"why-oh-why?\" movies where you want to turn away from the terrible decisions unfolding on screen - but can\\'t.  this is a tedious tale badly told.  despite all the outrageous comedy and raunchy bathroom jokes, [the zuckers] create endearing characters that are likable.  perfectly serviceable b-movie noir.  for lovers of all things violent and vengeful, the equalizer is a treat  a well-acted, but overlong, clunky, and underwhelming satire.   it\\'s a horror-comedy without much horror or comedy, because the seriousness of the protagonists\\' baggage saps away most of the humor, and the laid back filmmaking undercuts any opportunity for scares.  \"suffragette\" feels like a documentary in its visuals, but at the same time drowns in subjectivity.  it\\'s an amazing and touching true story that will have you on the edge of your seat and may even cause you to shed a tear or two.  a muddled revenge crime drama.  if there\\'s a movie worse than this set for release this year, let\\'s hope the distributor has the good sense not to do it.  it\\'s a middle-of-the-road anthology but boasts great energy and a sense of humor that runs throughout, helping make even the mediocre entries watchable.  it\\'s clean, has all the requisite eye candy and slapstick for the younger set, and -- most distinguishing of all -- an uncommon level of sophistication for the adults.  more informative than emotional, the documentary catches some of the angst involved in such an undertaking, but always appears to be engaging with the subjects at a respectful arm\\'s length.  structurally and narratively amputated, volume 1 retains head and guts but loses its heart and gams to the second installment.  much like the onslaught of sword-and-sandal epics, the comic-book-adaptation boom has resulted in a decreased effectiveness of the subjects.  david frost\\'s soft approach to nixon got results. this doesn\\'t.  the plot device of \"woman in trouble meets woman triumphant\" has grown a little long in the tooth lately but that doesn\\'t mean it doesn\\'t work.  on the whole, war is both a reasonable possible conclusion to the ape\\'s arc and a solid preparation for whatever comes next.  even though the film is marketed as a road movie for kids, it barely has any road in it and that\\'s just the least of its flaws.

[full review in spanish]  a one-of-a-kind experience that will confound, befuddle and amaze.  the increasingly diverse french director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking, sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history.  there are no surprises in this story, only the anticipation of justice being done one bad guy at a time until the final showdown.  louis zamperini\\'s life would make a great movie, if only somebody knew how to make it.  a sweet, often poignant little film.  as an observer of the various dimensions and dynamics of families, [director kore-eda hirokazu] is a modern master.  girault presents situations through an extreme romantized lense, full of warmness, dim lights and lacking any comunication or beleivability for the characters and the spectator. [full review in spanish]  rest assured, these crises will be resolved, and helen will be enriched by the experiences. but going through them with her throws more sugar into your system than i can take.  it\\'s not the actors that are the problem, it\\'s the material they\\'ve been given. the dialogue, the antiquated sense of humor, the obviousness of so many plot mechanics.  hunt for the wilderpeople masks its earnest sweetness with a giggling distrust of authority, making it at once heartfelt and mischievous.  we spend 100 years developing an art form that breaks out of the musty auditoria of the 19th century and where does it get us? right back where we started.  the auteur sees himself in the aviator, whose competence makes believers out of skeptics and who - in a critique of effects-driven blockbuster filmmaking - argues that \\'computer simulations\\' mean nothing when divorced from the \\'human\\' element.   defiance groans under the weight of its deadly earnestness: it\\'s handsomely mounted yet strangely inert.  a brilliant follow up to bispuri\\'s ambitious debut, daughter of mine is an expertly crafted, richly told meditation on mother/daughter dynamics and what those roles truly mean  the story hasn\\'t changed much, nor have the characters. but the comedy is now crude instead of whimsical and its characters overblown caricatures instead of screwball personalities. a movie has been reduced to a sketch.  gibney\\'s movies are professional and solidly executed, informative if you go in underinformed but rarely surprising or aesthetically noteworthy.  a wonderfully quiet, serene portrait of carthusian life edited to reflect the rhythm of the monastic regimen.  like so many films by snl alumni, it struggles to keep up the pace, and a few good scenes - or skits - are all you get.  it\\'s pretty special stuff as offered up by donoghue and director lenny abrahamson.  musketeers isn\\'t the worst picture anderson has made in the last decade, but it\\'s depressingly representative of his work -- he\\'s always eager to dazzle, but clueless on how to engage.  sentimental dreck of the fluffiest order.  this may be the best movie he\\'s made. it\\'s in french, by the way.  so cautious in dealing with the subject matter, so anxious to avoid the slightest hint of sensationalism, that it ends up exceedingly attractive to look at but curiously bland dramatically.   \"in dubious battle\" marks an embrace of a kind of anonymous, fuddy-duddy traditionalist approach. in short, it\\'s maybe james franco\\'s best-crafted film to date, and also maybe his dullest.  has enough memorably disturbing images to stick in viewers\\' minds without any explanation needed.  (tsui hark\\'s) romp plays exactly like the sino-centric spin on an indiana jones adventure that its title suggests it should.  matches documentary authenticity with dramatic intensity.  when they say they don\\'t make movies like they used to, this is exactly the type of film they\\'re talking about.  an unbelievably hokey, and, in spite of the terpsichore on display, resolutely lead-footed piece of mawkish melodrama.  a lackluster action-adventure.  the film\\'s and nancy\\'s nonjudgmental tone gives it a distinctly modern feel.  there\\'s enough of a storyline here to keep younger space cadets moderately settled.  arthur is riddled with clichés, suffers from a trite - occasionally offensive - screenplay, and has flatter direction than any russell brand vehicle deserves. [but] i could watch [he] and ... greta gerwig flirt for hours on end.  nanking doesn\\'t tell us why decency and compassion completely break down from time to time. it just tells us something terribly modern and all too familiar.  it has \\'cult\\' written all over it - and like most cults you\\'ll either get it . . . or you won\\'t.   richly entertaining and technically innovative, but it\\'s also a movie with an outspoken point of view about the direction in which american culture ought to be headed.  the plot is simple and the movie doesn\\'t live up to expectations. [full review in spanish]   so devoid of any spark that it feels like watching someone\\'s boring vacation videos.  forced jokes, ridiculous characters and a bad plot may get a laugh and maybe that\\'s enough for many. [full review in spanish]  more of the same, yes, but it\\'s the same stuff without the anarchic glee that permeated its predecessor.  a comedy, too exaggerated and repetitive, that has its best moments when they are unpredictable. [full review in spanish]  \"the revenant\" should be seen for its exquisite scenery, its realistic portrayal of men living 200 years ago in an unforgiving environment, and for leo.  no, it\\'s not a movie about two first ladies married to adulterous husbands.  \"a bigger splash\"? more like a small trickle.  it\\'s sarah polley through and through: slightly too glum for its own good, but reeking of quality and feeling.  shanghai noon was fun and shanghai knights is more of the same -- just not as much fun.  ...shallow, clichéd, sentimental, and derivative; but the cast makes up for the plot\\'s deficiencies with an amiable charm that\\'s hard to resist.  given how obsessed we are with politics, we deserve better films about it and the men who shape our nation.   with geoffrey rush as his star, stanley tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of alberto giacometti in this biopic... the artist\\'s messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there.  campion creates a nearly lethal dose of emotion-deprivation, turning spine tickling dread into something nearly dreadful.  a cringe-worthy confection...mom deserves better.  a powerfully engaging coming-of-age immigration sports documentary-style drama. and this unpredictable genre mash-up is pure magic.  utterly charming, graceful, and poignant.   what gives these episodes cumulative impact is the group portrait that emerges of a well-meaning country in a state of drift.  personal shopper is an uncanny mix of ghost story and personal drama that never feels, even for a moment, like it\\'s playing into any genre conventions whatsoever -- the film is entirely its own entity.  written and directed with efficiency, cheer, and a refreshing lack of look-how-meta-clever-we-are egotism, the movie references just enough of the original touchstones and punchlines to please those who lived it the first time.  director niki caro deftly intercuts josey\\'s story with the anita hill-clarence thomas hearings, a smart, subtle move to tie in the things all women have had to go through.  a disappointing sequel that can\\'t replicate the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational, muppetational qualities of the film that brought jim henson\\'s creations back into the limelight.  nice effects work, a relatively swift-moving narrative, sweet performances, and, by now, a well-worn premise prove inspiring this time out, and not deadening.  the film portrays this period as a golden era for journalism. in many ways it was a golden age, but the real heroes were the whistleblowers and reporters, and that\\'s no slight to the real risks editors and publishers like bradlee and graham took.  a tense buildup and a frenetically-paced final act combine for a fitting tribute to those who perished and the survivors of the disastrous oil rig explosion and resulting spill.  it\\'s an unintentionally comedic look at mankind\\'s selfish disinterest toward anyone in danger -- except for family.  cue multitudes of stolen moments.  more darkness than light, \\'a wrinkle in time\\' has much to iron out.  [a] calculatedly emotional, sterilizingly cleancut drama.  hallelujah, it\\'s fun.  the biggest waste of talent of any movie this year.  ever get the feeling the film you\\'re watching wasn\\'t actually finished?  eighteen short films, each done by a different director with a different cast and set in a different neighborhood of paris, je t\\'aime is a remarkable achievement.  the narrative dares to break the insular hermeticism reflecting that triangular intercommunication between sergio, sergei and peter. [full review in spanish]  few of the dialogue scenes match the expressiveness of vargas\\'s night-time street shuffle, or jourdain\\'s closing-credit solo.  even though the screenplay strains credibility at times, and the music really isn\\'t that great, the thoughtful premise is handled with sensitivity instead of crassness.   kenner\\'s sympathies are clear - \"don\\'t let them stack the deck!\" the film proclaims - and ultimately merchants of doubt does a much better job of making you think than convincing you of what to think.  an endearing blend of myth and melodrama that forthrightly explores family abuse in its own society.  this movie often plays like a super-expensive, 21st-century version of one of those \"star wars\" knockoffs made around 1980 by people who weren\\'t george lucas.  beck ... is very good on volume but not much for tension, suspense or frightening anyone.  to call the hunt gripping would be like calling annie hall funny. it is, but it\\'s also so much more than that.  overall, hummus! the movie was informative and well-framed.  wright has affectionately lampooned the horror and action genres in the past, but baby driver proves he is now a legitimate action director in his own right.  this is a slow-burning, very well acted film that contains, almost disconcertingly, a graphic sex scene, a strange star-cameo very late on, and something close to a hollywood ending.  j-lo, reminds us why she got to be famous in the first place.  miracles from heaven is manipulative, blunt, super-christian propaganda that\\'s dignified and deeply moving in its own way.  the more you think about it, the more you see all the subtextual tricks that were missed.  all told - and this film knows exactly who its audience is - a reminder of what famously enriching company habitual stoners are.  indeed, it\\'s the best movie comedy to come out of england since monty python packed up the circus.  plays like an update of the time-honoured full monty formula - public exhibitionism vanquishes english emotional reserve - for a post-glee world.  woefully unsuitable for children with its decades-old nods to r-rated films, \\'hoodwinked too! hood vs. evil\\' is a far cry from the much cleverer original.  all mr. woodcock gives us is mediocre comedy at its finest.  although younger children will doubtless love it, hotel for dogs is too often cute for its own sake to really entertain anyone else.  as always, hart unleashes his manic energy on the audience, but his heart doesn\\'t seem to be in it the way it was in the original. maybe he\\'s getting tired of the shtick, too.  beyond the hype there is an interesting story here, and luckily, morgan spurlock found it.  thriller movies should never make the audience feel safe. bird box is a bullock vehicle that lacks emotion. [full review in spanish]  the scenery ain\\'t bad but the laughs are tumbleweed-sparse in \"the ridiculous 6,\" a western sendup so lazy and aimless, it barely qualifies as parody.  srong on character and atmosphere but weak on story and excitement.  all these moments are held together by stanton, who gets to have the final word on his career. the opening credits read \"harry dean stanton is lucky,\" and it\\'s clear throughout the film that he was, and so were we.  the story reaches a critical mass of muddled implausibility when an already suspicious protagonist is revealed to be homicidally untrustworthy and the cloverfield beastie gets a moment in the sun.  a movie star and his neglected daughter bond while partaking in the celeb-filled glamour of the chateau marmont.  in his attempt to spoof destination weddings of the bankrupt and the famous, vikas bahl, (who also directed that gem, queen) forgot to take a script along.  read the wikipedia page. you\\'ll learn more.  chazelle tells armstrong\\'s story with certainty and verve.  law tears into his role like he\\'s like one of shakespeare\\'s most scabrous lost characters somehow unleashed in the modern world, and he clearly relishes the grit and the gristle.  with piercing hilarity, the kindergarten teacher dares us to work out for ourselves, from moment to moment, whether lisa is a hero, a monster, or something in between.  rozema\\'s handling of the entangled amours and social gamesmanship at mansfield park is delightful...it\\'s impure austen, but potent moviemaking.  a genial, shambling portrait of a first, obsessive infatuation.  uzumaki progresses like the life cycle of a butterfly, only the subjects begin as human beings and contort into giant snails, powerless to stop their bodies from betraying them.  annie hall expanded woody allen\\'s canvas to incorporate real wisdom alongside the punchlines.  superbly crafted grisham potboiler runs for over two hours, feels like forty-five minutes.  pleasantly goofy horror time-killer.  identity doesn\\'t outfox the audience; it just makes us feel like suckers.  zodiac, the latest film from director david fincher, is among his best  the rare film that manages to be simultaneously bland and offensive.  smith keeps the fog, mist and rain machines working overtime, but to such little purpose that black death often looks like outtakes from fiddler on the roof.  a gripping, political thriller packed with tremendous performances and supremely confident direction by george clooney.  in the end, despite its quirky twists on the genre, wyrmwood is just another zombie flick, riffing on its predecessors and hoping that\\'ll suffice.   visually, it\\'s tedious, comprising staid, greyish greens. what\\'s weirder is that the film is in english (though the accents are german), a distancing device that distracts.  there\\'s no way i can recommend this movie to anyone much beyond the tooth fairy believement age, but i must testify it\\'s pleasant and inoffensive, although the violence in the hockey games seems out of place.  stylish, witty and beautifully shot, though very much from the viewpoint of charming robber forrest; a thief with a gun is still a thief with a gun. spacek and redford delight; i never believed in the relationship between forrest and the cop on his tail.  hirokazu kore-eda\\'s new film is the sleeper hit of 2018. the japanese filmmaker has become a master of humanity, his films are true reflections of how we as flawed individuals are embraced by those closest to us, family.  enough laughs and entertainment value you have to give them more than a little credit for what they\\'re able to pull off and get away with.  both anderson\\'s most tightly wound and funniest film in years, lacking the melancholy charm of the royal tenenbaums or moonrise kingdom perhaps, but more than making up for it in terms of elegantly capering contrivance.  the movie is charming in spite of itself, even if you don\\'t really care about the characters, the mystery or the resolution.  the problem with the film is that that story, hackneyed when it first made it to the screen in 1984, has grown only more tired over the past 26 years.  brie larson and jacob tremblay offer a couple of performances so out of series that are literally unforgettable. [full review in spanish]  blade ii is certainly not without interest... but mostly, it looks and feels so much like a video game that some members of the audience will feel their thumbs twitching before the final reel.  a traditional zombie film introduced as a romantic-comedy and infected with a sly british-cum-\"the simpsons\" intelligence and sensibility.  movies like unbroken don\\'t work if you lose sight of what makes them unique.  an overly earnest, melodramatic musical mishmash   repeats bits and even characters from the earlier films, hoping viewers won\\'t notice, or that lightning will strike again.  watching a spy sit on the couch waiting for text messages from higher-ups may not sound as compelling as a le carré novel, but it\\'s a necessary build to a pulse-pounding third act that reveals how lives are destroyed by half-truths and hearsay.  there is a curious absence of development in this film.  is it sci-fi? fantasy? idiocy? mostly it\\'s a droning mess -- pretty to look at but confounding to the point where you just don\\'t care any more.  this is a solid family film material, although one suspects the children will get a little more out of it than their parents.  depalma repeating himself is better than most filmmakers saying something for the first time.  the cinematography here is enough to make you swoon. would that the story were equally compelling.  ...an intriguing and seemingly foolproof scenario that\\'s rendered increasingly irrelevant by fiala and franz...  a thoughtful perspective on attitudes to homosexuality in the church and polish society and chyra\\'s strong performance make this a poignant drama.  part two is where things start to get more serious, and the film suffers for it.  features even more toddlers acting in a way only collectors of velvet paintings will consider irresistible.  the characters are realistically flawed and the film tackles grief in a way that is completely believable. james mcavoy and jessica chastain are perfectly imperfect together. but the unpolished script slows it down and makes it feel unpleasantly erratic.   the return is a slow burn that\\'s often way too slow, feeling stretched to meet a running time that\\'s still under 90 minutes.  david cronenberg meets don delillo at last, and it\\'s as if all the angels of heaven have come together. and said nothing.  if you\\'re going to champion style over substance, you\\'ll want danny boyle providing the style.  what starts out as a delightful black comedy and social commentary ends up, at best, as a guilty pleasure where i had a hard time sorting out the intentional from the unintentional laughs.  alas, there\\'s no real sense of tension as the story (credited to three writers) lurches toward a by-the-numbers ending.  magically, unexpectedly, most funkily, get on up feels fresh and crisp as the godfather of soul\\'s keenest moves.   eastwood delivers a ferociously emotional tale that matches, and in some respects surpasses, the artistry of last year\\'s mystic river.  action-movie aficionados know to look forward to besson\\'s spatially energized productions, and the new film taken maintains his high standards.  one might say that the act of killing and the look of silence... are two halves of a diptych - or uneasy neighbours, like the former members of the komando aksi killing squads and their families, and the families of their victims.  garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work.  the director manages to extract precisely the same numbed unease from a murder, an embrace, or a moment of dead time in which someone looks out the window.  a complete delight. i laughed, i gasped, and i cried, as did the entire screening audience i watched the film with. how many other films can boast that kind of a balancing act?  in the end, this adaptation may not be all that different than effective screen tearjerkers of the past, but in staying true to its source material, its infinity is bound to be a little bigger than most.  with a sprawling production that spans many international locations, traitor is efficient and convincing.  alpha is a tale that transcends time and space to tell a beautiful story of friendship between humans and animals.  sure, it\\'s a fairly broad sex comedy, but it\\'s a sweet one.  it\\'s hard not to appreciate the astute ways the script captures the moment when carefree childhood turns into the loss of innocence.  shannon shows new shades in her deft handling of a tragedy she\\'s tasked with bearing. further proof that when it comes to drama, comedy actors are often the experts.  so utterly unimaginative it doesn\\'t even count as hommage; it\\'s just a smudgy copy of a still chilling original.  far too high-and-mighty to truly be moving.  fans will undoubtedly thrive on every second. for the rest of us, monster is precisely that: a creature powerful but ungainly.  bride of chucky strings together a series of humorous asides and knee-jerk shock tactics.  the movie might make for a good book, but it\\'s too awkward and lacks the necessary action for a film. and williams\\' rather sluggish approach doesn\\'t help much. eventually, we just aren\\'t interested in tagging along with him.  the result is a well-acted, well-reasoned two-hander that struggles to swerve around the contrivances of the genre.  an unusual, oddly satisfying film that\\'s part road movie and part emotional drama.  ...the sort of light, breezy entertainment that feels a lot more like george roy hill or peter bogdanovich than it does ridley scott.  i\\'m thinking dan brown\\'s robert langdon books weren\\'t meant to be made into movies.  this sequel to fletch, in which chase played novelist gregory mcdonald\\'s los angeles newspaperman-detective, seems to have a chip on its shoulder, daring an audience not to laugh.  with a handful of solid laughs and a modicum of snappy dialogue, it\\'s liable to amuse, if not overwhelm, an audience seeking casual, forgettable entertainment.  sometimes borderline risible, but even so, one can\\'t but fail to be impressed it got made at all, given the subject is really mostly of interest to design geeks and those fascinated by intellectual property law.  tale of tales is a mixed bag of stories-but the bag itself is made of the finest visual velvet.  reminds us that from the bitter rivalries to the torn jerseys worn in pickup games to the dreams of gridiron glory, sports teams belong to the fans.  everything is more tentative, more generic.  vividly rendered but increasingly repetitive and aimless.  there is considerable satisfaction in seeing these tyrants of high finance live up to their image as the new villains of modern cinema, but even more satisfying are tykwer\\'s superbly staged action set pieces.  doesn\\'t necessarily make for a bad movie, in this politically alienated time we are currently living in, it does leave me worrying that it will deepen the racial and socio-economic divide in this country.  in a speech toward the end of the final year, obama muses that while history zigs and zags, \"the trendlines, ultimately, will be in the direction of a less violent, more empathetic, more generous world.\" if only it were so.  highly compelling and entertaining.  the movie is a missed opportunity. it has all the ingredients of a delightfully twisted, sleek little thriller. but with all that extra padding, mr. brooks is just one bloated mess.  rudo y cursi never quite figures out what it wants to be. is it a sports comedy? a tale of sibling rivalry? a look at mexico\\'s gritty underbelly, set against a soccer backdrop?  one of the most relentlessly abusive movies you will ever see - the dialogue is a non-stop torrent of profanity, and the action consists of one brutal beating after another. yet it cries out to be seen.  it\\'s titanic meets gladiator but not as good as either. if you don\\'t have time to read the rest of the review, that should do you just fine.  terrifically entertaining blockbuster that, for once, gets everything right.  the film is touching because it is very honest.  there are less laughs in this tired threquel, which continues to revel in its not-quite-a-swear surname and the ups and downs of family life, this time with an added emphasis on kids and mortality.  with a screenplay so childish it might as well have been written in crayola, the heat is at its best when it simply gives the tremendously talented mccarthy room to improvise.  ugh, arthur is everything that\\'s wrong with remakes wrapped up in a one hundred minute package.  even as it acknowledges its inspirations, manmarziyaan strikes out in decidedly different directions.  duvernay\\'s look at martin luther king\\'s 1965 voting-rights march against racial injustice stings with relevance to the here and now. oyelowo\\'s stirring, soulful performance as king deserves superlatives.   one of the funniest movies of the year, and in its own loony way, it\\'s a sharp, dead-on satire.  nakata - here making his english language debut - fails to drum up much in the way of tension from the plot\\'s hoky attempt to exploit fears about the existence of online suicide clubs.  the third time out for the vampire-hunting superhero is no charm.  the plot keeps you guessing and is constantly throwing the characters off track; only the camp factor prohibits you from caring quite as much as you should.  throw in a couple of ugly new characters and one semi-nauseating barf joke, and \"the nut job 2\" marks the emergence of a consistently tone-deaf animated franchise.  this unnerving and frustratingly opaque drama focuses on a teenage boy who distrusts his own memories and present reality.   we gotta give shannon credit for staying in fine schoolgirl form for superstar\\'s 90 minutes or so of teen silliness.  most action movies these days forgo the script in favor of slam-bang visuals and stunts, but basic actually suffers from too much plot.  the problem is that jp3 operates mostly on a 12-year-old\\'s level. for the rest of us it\\'s deja vu all over again.  a hilarious, acerbic political satire of a kind rarely seen on american screens.  reduces global terrorism to a rubik\\'s cube suitable for an evening\\'s entertainment. if that doesn\\'t make you vaguely ill, by all means take this thriller for the shallow, gimmicky \"ride\" it aspires to be.  by focusing on the power of cannily staged collective action to turn the tide of public opinion, selma achieves a contemporary relevance that few historical dramas can ...  vijay antony also scores as a composer, delivering good melodies like \\'arumbey\\' and \\'nooraai\\'. both songs are already popular.  sweet, charming...and not particularly funny for even a moment.  a comedy that feels as if it were dreamed up in the wee hours between bong hits and shots of tequila.  david gordon green somehow brings together the poetic sensibility of his independent art movies and the humorous lowbrow non sequiturs of his studio comedies; the results are one of a kind and often weirdly moving.   a vital if less than objective slice of film journalism on the u.s.\\'s troubled history in the third world.  quiet moments after big decisions are where the power lies in this absorbing french drama.  the performances and luscious cinematography are highlights of \"the light between oceans\"; it didn\\'t overwhelm me with feels but certainly is a worthy entrance into what is hopefully a satisfying award season.  guy ritchie\\'s take on arthurian myth is a misbegotten mash-up of sword-and-sorcery action fantasy and geezers-on-a-mission caper. it\\'s all booming cgi and lairy banter. bish bash bosh!   at certain moments, watching it felt like inhaling laughing gas mixed with helium.  in such able hands, the film transcends its generic restrictions.  it doesn\\'t take a conspiracy theorist to detect dark skies\\'s thinly veiled conservatism, and it doesn\\'t take an undue alarmist to be disturbed by the implications of this sort of fear-mongering.  a thin layer of gender jokes around a lot of recycled indiana jones predicaments, cliffs, snakes, monuments and charging animals. manages to be feel both too eventful and monotonous at the same time  forty-five minutes in, i was already glancing at my watch and wondering why the only lively actress in this film was playing the dead girl. go figure.  the script is based almost entirely on audiences buying for one second that a financially strapped andy would ever take joyce on an impulsive road trip of this nature, for reasons so ridiculous.  it\\'s as much an auditory narrative as a visual one, which makes perfect sense.  the funniest movie of 2013  while it alludes to themes concerning xenophobia, communication and social responsibility, ultimately the film amounts to little more than a collection of stark, uneven vignettes.  the film belongs to garcia, who is in literally every shot. wafting over garcia\\'s face at different moments are contentment, frustration, loneliness, disappointment, happiness.  if you think it\\'s a good idea to begin a movie for children by killing off a young boy in an industrial accident as his father looks on, raise your hand. anyone?  a grand adventure, thrillingly told.  grassroots is an incredibly unimaginative and painfully dull film -- perhaps one of most erroneous entries of the year.  as the black-and-white archive footage of the trenches and front lines floods into sickly greens and oranges, a 100-year gap suddenly springs shut.  a spright, persistently funny look at a woman flailing in a comic swirl of mid-life turmoil....bridget is in her mid-40s here, so what [we] now need is one more film where we see bridget in her 60s trying to bring up a 21st century teenager.  but like ripley and his mission, this gorgeous film sabotages the bizarre journey it originally offered.  the last samurai earns every minute of its near two-and-one-half hour running length. there\\'s no fat to trim, and no sense that scenes have been included to pad the ego of the director and/or his star.  senior-citizen buddy comedy has salty language, sex.   at least it means well.  superficial and unsatisfying...  there are some amusing ideas here and there, but they\\'re not developed into anything particularly memorable.  the conflicted pacifism of \\'munich\\' suggests spielberg\\'s vision is maturing.  kingdom of heaven lands somewhere between oliver stone\\'s yawn-inducing alexander and troy, the brad pitt pecs flexer, as sand-and-sandal entertainment.  it\\'s a film that swears by the golden formula of crowd-pleasing sentimentality: let viewers laugh at the struggles and share in the triumphs.  outbreak movie that devolves into yet another zombie knockoff.  since there always seems to be more going on in the head of the film\\'s director than in the head of the man playing andrei, the system did not work for me.  this oddball little concoction from the lonely island group of saturday night live fame manages to navigate a sweet center with the utmost precision.  biting but good-natured, incisive but not preachy, this is the kind of self-reflective comedy that can bring america together.  match point is a good movie -- a good, solid movie.  it\\'s the first von trier film that is not a tiresome practical joke on the audience.  one of the weaker entries in the series.  mira nair mistakenly makes the conniving becky a symbol of modern feminist pluckiness.  it\\'s the rare film that gets deep into low income inner city life and zeroes in on what motivates those whom society tends to forget.  the final sequence, in which the directors boldly refuse any neat tying-up of their story, is bracingly intelligent. lawlor and molloy are real talents with a distinctive, if evolving, film-making language of their own.  i don\\'t know much about ballet, and i liked the elaborately detailed la danse, but i suspect dance buffs are going to devour it.  it may be that coppola was right to put off filing this last installment all these years; from the evidence here, he had nothing more to say.  the dark knight is noisy, jumbled, and sadistic.  not as good as borat, but thankfully not bruno, there are some huge laughs to be had. and no, i\\'m not praising the film because aladeen threatened me ... though i wouldn\\'t put it past him.  i ended up really enjoying it...and looking forward to the sequel we are clearly being prepared for. sherwood forest and all.  for a film so full of automotive iconography, it\\'s a conclusion that remains frustratingly in the middle of the road.  ...the dardennes have fashioned their most accessible and relatable drama yet, one that works as a suspense thriller even as it exposes some miserable machiavellian truths and darwinian terrors.   appealing not to the lowest common denominator but the shortest, i.e., the toddler set, barred due to the r rating. or, as one young lad said to his friend in the sandbox: \"waaaaaah!\"  jersey boys is a solid watch that seeks to deepen the emotion of the jukebox musical.  changeling is little more than a frustrating missed opportunity that\\'s dressed to the nines, but a day late for the party.  while the film showcases moments of enormous power, there is something missing; perhaps it\\'s subtlety, or perhaps it\\'s the emotional connection the movie so desperately wants to make, but in the end, can\\'t quite achieve.  overall, beats is a good film. welsh\\'s intentions are clear and his passion is palpable.   clearly a vanity project, smith perhaps imagines this plot device will signify to the world that he\\'s ready to pass the action hero mantle on to his son, but it takes more than nepotism to make a movie star.  it\\'s not a total descent into romantic hell, but it gives a comprehensive tour of the upper circles.  forget evolution, this franchise needs a hard reset.  the series is losing its steam.  the killer\\'s final lines suggest a gleeful, pitch black perversity that the rest of shield of straw could have used, but instead it\\'s a thoroughly below average genre flick that\\'s empty on ideas and entertainment value.  this is a film that appeals to the head far more than to the heart, making for a portrait that seems somewhat less than complete.  mike nichols\\' fast-talking political comedy says every word but osama bin laden.  a stellar documentary highly suggested for horror buffs, film lovers, and aspiring filmmakers alike.  jude law\\'s dom remains an artificial construct, never the least bit real or empathetic, rather a creature of fiction - and an implausible one at that.  manhattan is nothing more than a trite christmas present from lopez. this film seemed to last longer than some of her relationships.  full of cliches and the very stereotypes against which director spike lee rails, \"miracle at st. anna\" is a television movie that\\'s far below the capabilities of one of the most talented living film directors.  the movie, which is as visually stunning as anything you could hope to see put on celluloid, still manages to feel emotionally hollow.  in essence, the film is exactly what one comes to expect in the telling of the story. hardwicke brings absolutely nothing to the table, except for a colorless palette. the actors struggle to invest what are essentially plaster saints with some verve, but  the filmmakers are obviously hoping that they are making up in mood what they\\'re failing to provide in narrative logic, but a guy staring at static is a guy staring at static.  a glorified powerpoint presentation interspersed with commentary by people of questionable qualifications who aim to incite paranoia with propaganda, conspiracy theories and straw-man arguments.  garrel carefree films with continuity on the same subjects of always and with conflicts and similar personages. [full review in spanish]  especially well handled are the screen realizations of dunaway\\'s premonitions. they look like a blurred videotape, as she explains to jones at one point, a conception which works well on screen.  the movie rarely conveys the import of what these kids accomplished: as depicted here, their cultural revolution seems no more noteworthy than a day spent at the mall.  if it suffers, it mostly only suffers in comparison to the other ocean\\'s films.  ...the most cinematic elements of the novel are the weakest parts of the movie.  the filmmakers and writers have messed with the bloodsucking legend, supplying stunning visuals but not much bite.  the way one of the most exciting contemporary filmmakers plays with the narrative is an undeniable triumph. [full review in spanish]  seeing that big red \"s\" on the big screen again is an exciting experience. welcome, home, supe. we missed you.  vanity fair is a timeless story about life lived, and a skewering of upper class society. am i less of a man for falling in love with this female friendly movie?  a full 120 minutes dedicated to the hilarious comic notion that white people can\\'t dance (hee, hee - it\\'s funny because it\\'s true, we\\'re so lame!)  the audience paid for money shots, and money shots are what they get.  mercifully, it\\'s a mad dash to the final finish line.  neeson isn\\'t going to win an oscar for this but he\\'s re-affirmed his position as hollywood\\'s favourite and least likely action star.  bad moms may not surprise you, but it will make you laugh. quite a lot, actually.  self-consciously written and directed redemption saga that\\'s certainy not as compelling as other dramas in this british gangland genre.  as is, jones is entertaining, but would have been a lot better if it wasn\\'t geared toward families.  this movie has everything to do with estevez\\'s needy ego, and nothing to do with bobby kennedy. it is a disgrace.  lacks credibility by pushing the delusory envelope.  an equally tender and devastating father-and-daughter effort that\\'s handled with supreme sensitivity and shot with unwavering kindness.  likely to remain the best movie of the year.  never before have i seen [dafoe] display the particular emotions that he displays in this film.  strange and darkly beautiful, a slave to no master\\'s rhythms or rules other than its own.  the cameos are distracting, the plot loses its rhythm before disintegrating completely and the seemingly endless decapitations and brutal deaths will lead even the most hardened of action fans to seek religion after the credits roll.  it\\'s like subtlety heard the purge was starting and took off running.  house bunny\\'s legally blonde roots show.  too generic to offer many scares  let\\'s hope the humor is intentional; it\\'s frankly hard to tell.  a fun adventure that always seems to get mixed up in my memory with mary poppins, and while they share similarities, this one stands out on its own as a great childrens film.  \"straight outta compton\" goes right to the heart of what made n.w.a. one of the most defiant groups of all time.  doesn\\'t even consider itself surprising enough to tack on a question mark.  there are a few hiccups from the book\\'s transition to screen, but more often than not, noyce\\'s picture is an entertaining and thoughtful adaptation.  there is no shortage of trouble, violence and humiliation awaiting them and twists and a growing sense of love and acceptance, on both sides. this is a buddy story to end \\'em all.  mcg tries to turn this means war into a cool pop confection along the lines of his charlie\\'s angels movies. but pouring on the douchey hipness and charm only makes things worse.  firsttime teaming of cary grant and audrey hepburn, a natural, gives the sophisticated romantic caper an international appeal, plus the selling points of adventure, suspense and suberb comedy.  the second part in the arabian nights saga slowly but surely raises a middle finger to the portuguese establishment.  tugs at the heartstrings like a toe-fingered harpist.  unfortunately, the script of anesthesia supports the ballast of an excessive verbosity and the proposed subplots don\\'t acquire a greater dramatic density. [full review in spanish]  kevin smith hasn\\'t matured enough to actually make a good comedy, but he has accrued enough casting wisdom to elevate his latest homegrown material with the effervescent seth rogan and elizabeth banks.  it\\'s a simultaneously modest and massively ambitious undertaking, so original in its conception and so successful in its execution that it deserves to be remembered as a landmark achievement.  management is ultimately undone by its own bland idiosyncrasies. it\\'s nothing but a mismanaged opportunity.  it simply isn\\'t satisfying, and for all mckay\\'s refusal to succumb to clichéd dramatics the movie needs something.  what pinter and branagh present is a much more wicked, cold, disturbing film that is even more confined than the original.  can a film be true to a classic literary source and still seem fresh? the answer is yes, and the proof is the new adaptation of jane eyre.   initially, it seems as if viewers are in for the same sort of frat-boy nonsense that sandler flings out with virtually all his live-action projects. thankfully, the movie soon shies away from that position and instead manages to deliver genuine laughs.  the question of just why audiences need (or want) a rebooted 3d origin story for a film franchise only a few year\\'s cold remains to be convincingly answered.  like a family scrapbook - benn himself approved the final cut - what is contained here is carefully curated, chosen to represent in a certain way but thanks to benn\\'s unnerring conviction, is no less fascinating for that.  jab tak hai jaan (jthj) is yash chopra\\'s last film as director and it\\'s a film rich in philosophy, poetic love and honest emotions.  the film might have been more charming with ray harryhausen effects than with cgi  it\\'s easy to get seduced by the sumptuous cinematography of \"the song of scorpions,\" but all that beauty becomes mere window-dressing since the script is too weak to support the potentially interesting story.  good, or bad, the entire crew is back and looking buff and beautiful. and who cares if only a precious few of them can act when all anybody needs to do is grunt and grip a steering wheel as if their checkered careers depended on it.  the present edition, in spite of an impressive cast, is a blood bath that is more violent than any before, but to no avail.   there are none of the big laugh-out-loud moments one would expect from these two very talented and hilarious performers.   ...hanks\\' and vardalos\\' treatment of a middle-aged joe heading back to the classroom is about as believable as rodney dangerfield\\'s back to school - and not half as entertaining.  a haunting, funny, beautifully austere film about obsession, delusion and fantasy, all held together by the remarkable, and the remarkably still, performance by rinko kikuchi.  [green book]... flees from the typical trappings of the biopic genre to which it belongs, offering a quite universal story. [full review in spanish]  a flat, joyless affair.  hokey doesn\\'t even begin to describe it.  a shattering tale of bravery and unrewarded loyalty.  stanley nelson\\'s studious history shows that even without the law enforcement campaign of disinformation, infiltration, and assassination, the black panthers would have imploded on their own.  team lewis has done a memorable job flushing out this complicated man.  file this one in the category of entertaining historical fiction. there are facts here, but one must possess more than a passing familiarity with history to be able to spot them.  ethan hawke and sarah snook, who plays the unmarried mother, are nearly ideal casting for these characters. they\\'re engagingly enigmatic-a requirement for playing mystery men-yet they also react to each other body and soul.  it is a fabulous \"what if?\" and siegel\\'s screenplay squeezes drama out of every possible story permutation.  the woman in black has lovely period atmosphere. unfortunately, it doesn\\'t have much else besides atmosphere.  despite a few good ideas and flashes of genius in the script, the whole film is a total bore.  there\\'s a real joy there -- genuine feelings of warmth that the cinema rarely manages to convey with such unalloyed sincerity.  as it should be with a film like this, the most fascinating aspect is the examination of kusama\\'s process, its evolution, and the psychology that drives it.  overlong and overwrought, orphan stays faithful to every cliché of the genre.  side effects points out, but never didactically, just how broken our systems have become, whether medical, governmental, or economic.  ayoade is better at establishing a road map of what \"submarine\" is supposed to be rather than pulling all its elements together cohesively.  it hurts to say this because i was hoping i wouldn\\'t have to type \"post-apocalyptic\" for awhile, but who knew denzel would make it worth the trip?  on the basis of their three feature films, directors phil lord and christopher miller are masters of transforming unlikely source material into something wonderful.  cruel comic mishaps may be this movie\\'s raison d\\'être, but they are softened at every turn by the gentle humanity of the city\\'s inhabitants, and by the unspoken sense that everything will turn out fine in the end.  the term \"pass over\" is loaded with meanings in antoinette nwandu\\'s gut-punch of a play.  writer-director rod lurie\\'s remake of the notorious straw dogs isn\\'t a terrible movie. it\\'s just not an exceptional one, a liability that increases exponentially with the quality of the original film.   there\\'s just one problem: the story.  what price, happiness?  \"this is the height of my career,\" says jason statham sarcastically in his latest potboiler ...  though alan clarke\\'s original film still has the edge, this perhaps has more relevance for a new generation of cinemagoers.  the drama never swamps the film\\'s humour, and it combines a glossy hollywood sense of wonder with that classic star trek optimism. in the uncertain world we live in, it couldn\\'t feel more timely.  a capably done account of a presidential career that was wrecked by a crime that was unnecessary.  within the canon of boston gangster movies, this one is decidedly of the first order.  the slasher stuff isn\\'t half bad, but you have to suffer through comedy material that feels like glass in your brain.  delivered with all the subtlety of a crotch to the face, magic mike xxl is one of the most cynical, shallow sequels in recent memory.  how such a franchise became one of hollywood\\'s most successful, i\\'ll never understand.  man on a ledge flirts with b-movie greatness but comes up short thanks to the far-fetched plot device used to power a clunky hybrid of heist flick/hitchcockian wrong-man thriller.  as the perfect antidote to dr. dolittle 2\\'s sappy blandness, the relentlessly inventive and entertaining cats and dogs comes along at just the right time.  taking over screenwriting duties from the original\\'s scott lobdell and straining the silliness past breaking, director christopher landon mounts a sequel that forgets to be scary.  the wachowski brothers disappear down the rabbit hole with the matrix reloaded.  regrettably, an overblown finale and redundant trick ending undercut the mild subversiveness of what\\'s gone before.  surprisingly smart and filled with homage, paul is crass and a little rough around the edges, but thoroughly enjoyable.  this s&m satire teeters on the verge of sleaze and exploitation but never descends into those domains due to maggie gyllenhaal\\'s exquisite performance in a tricky role.  my pick: the animated short of the year surely must be domee shi\\'s \\'bao,\\' a bittersweet reverie on motherhood that features one of the most hilariously shocking moments onscreen this year.  even if - despite the fact - men still feel the need to point out the obvious in 2019, bader ginsburg and [director mimi] leder are much-appreciated proof that change takes time, is arduous and worth it.  the movie references may strike some as in-jokey, but guest\\'s likeable film has enough jaundiced sideswipes and lighter chuckles to see it through its slacker spells.  at heart a philosophical allegory that pits cruise\\'s nihilism against foxx\\'s optimistic humanism  bone-chillingly told and beautifully made, ghost stories is an expert twist on an evergreen genre.  few social scientists are able to enliven an issue like connolly and anderson, and few documentarians have their dramatic intuition.  the words thinks it can outsmart us...providing one of those \"what if\" endings that raises such questions. without some idea of the possible answer, however, all we get is frustration.   the 5th wave is an unintentionally humorous excuse for dumbed-down science fiction filmmaking. it\\'s painful to watch and as uninteresting as toenail fungus.  a good vengeance thriller without flourishes or concessions. [full review in spanish]  a riveting drama that takes us into territory previously unexplored in gangster movies.  if you love movies in the very sinews of your imagination, you should experience the work of guy maddin.  if you\\'re partial to cats and don\\'t mind a bit of saccharine with your social realism, it\\'s the kind of movie to leave you purring in approval.  it is by far the funniest, most inventive and perfectly crafted comedy of the year.  it makes very few promises it can\\'t keep, but also goes halfway out on every limb it can find, risking next to nothing, sights permalocked on par.  the film\\'s pacing is usually either poky or too frenetic, almost never at the right clip to make even kiddie slapstick success.  i cannot in good conscience, however, recommend that anyone, man, woman or child-pay money to see this film, as being forced to sit in a cinema for the film\\'s 2-hour and 30-minute runtime was devastatingly exhausting.  animal requires a fairly high level of suspension of disbelief, but if you are willing to give it a try, you can enjoy a very intriguing thriller / character study. [full review in spanish]  instead of meticulously matching clues to revelations, it turns hercule poirot, agatha christie\\'s famous detective, into an unappealingly emotional holmes.  my interest waxed and waned. the set up for the film seemed to take eons. frank overstuffed the script with exposition, multiple subplots and some seemingly unnecessary sequences. just as i was ready to dismiss the movie, he switched gears.  costner and preston\\'s convincing work together go a long way in keeping the audience interested and involved.  the express finesses a cinematic hat trick: it\\'s entertaining, deeply moving and genuinely important.  a plodding, lazy and ravishingly dull biopic about a vicious and genuinely fascinating crime family set in the early eighties.  while zahn and davies offer amazing performances, bale\\'s starring turn often falls flat. herzog doesn\\'t give him much to work with: the writer-director is reluctant to allow his hero any flaws, even fear and despair, on his harrowing journey.  a fascinating and sensitive examination of jewish-nazi collaboration, generational amnesia and the delicate construction of the thing we call history.  on top of its historical significance, crazy rich asians is a great movie, period. i laughed, i cried, sometimes both at the same time. thanks jon m. chu and the phenomenal cast, it\\'s such a joyful experience that\\'s both funny and romantic.   rp1 may not be perfect, but it places spielberg back at his best.  fails to provide enough action and story that doesn\\'t shy itself away from falling to the tropes of a generic summer blockbuster.  some early sequences seem a tad uncertain, but a little way in all becomes surer of itself and, for now going on eighty years ago, a miracle.  the central problem of the movie is one of redundancy.  novel never quite dazzles despite its big-name cast, elaborate costumes, and loads of glitter  a young woman is trapped and terrorized in the isolated summer house her father and uncle are preparing for sale in this derivative thriller whose big twist horror fans will figure out long before it arrives.  director by j.d. dillard brings this under-the-radar drama close to genre cliches but deftly avoids them with his strong characters, fine storytelling, and vivid atmosphere.   how can a teen romantic fantasy not be at least some fun when the leading man\\'s lipstick is several shades redder than that of the ingénue?  impressively, \"gangs of wasseypur\" manages its sprawling story lines deftly and maintains a brisk pace throughout its daunting length.  surprisingly i came out of soul surfer without that sticky sweet feeling you get from too much schmaltz and only a strong desire to see annasophia robb in more moves and carrie underwood in far fewer.  a squall of improbabilities leads to a laughable late revelation, yet somehow the film keeps a clammy grip.  a great exercise in low budget filmmaking but not much of a monster movie.  capitalism\\'s aim is too scattershot. it\\'s old hat for moore to argue only one side of the story, but this is the first time he has so blatantly failed to focus on the issue at hand  it is an astonishing, vivid portrait not only of a time and place, but of an era\\'s spirit.  you never regret that nicole kidman ended up being the actress who got this made.  ...everything i liked about the original movie has been worn down.   eden\\'s formless and lackadaisical narrative perfectly captures the feel of the \\'90s french house era, both its rise and inevitable fall from grace.  while masterson\\'s script might come up a hair short, lumet remains firmly in control: even at 83, there\\'s nothing arthritic about his ability to engage our emotions or our intellect.  like most episodic tales, some episodes are better than others; but even the good ones aren\\'t as fully developed as they might be.  in america gets better after a muddled start.  ...its [a] sincere and loving reproduction of a tradition full of nuances. [full review in spanish]   like disney in a minor key, the film\\'s focus is on the true nature of family.  a tragically atrocious roadblock in the momentum baumbach established with his previous movie, neither recapturing any of that magic nor paving any new ground.  as the title character, michael fassbender gets the sob part down just fine, but there\\'s little evidence of the personal magnetism that enabled jobs to bend so many people to his will.  ultimately, her movie is about how her life, anybody\\'s life, is created out of oddments that never quite cohere, and don\\'t need to. the sheer sensuousness of all these bric-a-brac memories is sustaining.  a portrait of a happy man.  hong distills vast emotional crises and creative self-recognitions into confessional monologues, pugnacious discussions, and luminous aphorisms.  [i]n the end it\\'s just another macho fantasy about \"good guys\" with guns.  there are a number of cheeky winks from the filmmakers specifically aimed at harryhausen fans; in the end, though, leterrier\\'s clash of the titans is nearly as messy an assemblage of mythic odds and ends as the original.  for every breath he\\'s grasping for, you\\'re holding one in, anticipating what might follow.  while you could name the contents of pride\\'s cluttered collection of culture clashes and personal revelations well before they are laid out, the emotional authenticity of the movie... will swiftly win you over without warning.  a lavish, sensual and endlessly fascinating film that almost fetishes fetishism, this is provocative in every sense.  the trick to red 2\\'s success is its willingness to allow the actors to roar through all their greatest hits at the loudest possible volume.  one of this year\\'s must-see films, this is not simply a worthy tribute of a subject too often ignored by hollywood; it\\'s also a remarkable piece of cinema in its own right.  can the modern man handle brisseau\\'s cup of tea? the answer: dude! all-girl threesome!  a horror thriller, a political satire, a dysfunctional family comedy, and a touching melodrama, bong joon-ho\\'s the host is also one helluva monster movie.  as the details mount, and the star does what stars do, it starts to seem like a good bag of potato chips. there\\'s no nutritional value, but darned if you don\\'t keep eating.  a big fall-off from the inspired zaniness of green\\'s \"pineapple express,\" \"your highness\" lowers the lowbrow bar.  it didn\\'t belong in theaters, but it\\'s amusing and enjoyable.  a dog faces death, not because of cold or hunger, not because it was abandoned to face the polar winter alone, but because it was distracted and enamored by the southern lights?  this is a beautifully-photographed movie. i mean it.  buoyant and lightweight... except for brando, who is, in fact, rather heavy.  like its main character, it really comes alive when it catches the waves.   the worst use of a skynrd song since karaoke night at hooters.  much of the time, watching beyond the black rainbow is accompanied by head scratching, but perhaps that\\'s the point of this trippy outing.  this saga of demonic possession deploys the full audio firepower of modern multiplexes, and does so with brain-battering frequency, like a ghostbusting version of a japanese taiko drum ensemble.  ... the type of film that makes you wish time travel was real just so you could go back and experience it for the first time again  through hollywood contrivance, it stretches interest long enough to make it to the final goal of sport spirit.  there are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you.  one of the best films i\\'ve seen about the ways in which grief can pull a person in both directions simultaneously.  hbo knows how to produce a compelling biographical movie...   there\\'s only a moderate level of humor and suspense in this formulaic caper comedy that seems to borrow from a few genre predecessors.  a potent glimpse of doom with a jarringly familiar ring.  how many times have we seen the components of this plot? the crimes of the young; the trials of the old; the lone individual fighting for truth and decency. but they were never mixed like this before.  not only is this a strong early contender for worst film of the year, it could well be a candidate for the worst film ever made.  monstrously bad...sommers not only plunders the classic films for material but trashes what he\\'s cribbed from them.  easy to mock, but hard to truly dislike  following a twelve-year patent dispute regarding the invention of the intermittent windshield-wiper motor, it\\'s not as interesting as it sounds.  21 and over is pretty much for people with an iq of 21 and under.  \"retired & extremely dangerous\" this lot may well be, but after two films proving they can\\'t get it together, the emphasis really ought to be on retired.  daphne truly is a fascinating character study. emily beecham is astounding, portraying a layered and complex character, and one that we rarely see on screen.  michelle pfeiffer is quite good, but the script leaves kathy bates -- talented as she is -- with a bit of a cartoonish performance.  smug, artificial, ill-constructed and fatally overlong...it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite, degenerating into a pious, preachy soap opera.  casa de los babys isn\\'t a perfect film. it ultimately seems brief and leaves too much of the women\\'s (and children\\'s) fates to our imagination...  a restrained, world-weary impression of the various american attempts (from torture, interrogation, surveillance, and the final hi-tech marine raid) to track down bin laden.  a leaden adaptation of zola\\'s 19th century story of guilt and betrayal  sometimes unknown\\'s tongue is so firmly in cheek that the audience doesn\\'t even realize there\\'s a joke happening.  frank ... keeps things tense enough that we may not have time to notice one or two failings in the script.  some movies just deserve to be tucked away into obscurity. this is one of those movies.  a thoroughly delightful documentary celebrating ireland\\'s wonderfully unique old pubs, the marvellous characters who run and patronise them, and the roles they\\'ve played in irish life down the centuries.   digs deep into the subject of piracy, arguing that it\\'s less an anachronism than a sign of the times.  filmmaker cameron crowe can\\'t catch a break with aloha, a hawaii-set romcom that is a handful of stories struggling for a unifying tone, but is nowhere near as toxic as its advance buzz.   it\\'s all pretty dizzying to process on first viewing, even more difficult to extricate from the incredible legend and circumstance that surrounds its existence.   there\\'s a witty sense of humor at work here -- that turns wicked in the third act -- much of it at the expense of literary pretension and both the egotism and insecurity that lead to ill-advised sexual dalliances.  if you\\'re looking for women in feathered boas doing high kicks to an assortment of vintage sounding musical numbers then nine delivers. so do the rockettes.  it shouldn\\'t be viewed as the wedding crashers 2, as that will only raise expectations and create disappointment. but it works as a different, mainstream comedy.  for the first 15 minutes or so cars 3 seems like a dash-for-the-cash affair. then disney does what they do best: they get viewers emotionally involved with the characters.  but despite all of bay\\'s best efforts, he still managed, through sheer dumb luck, to wind up with a cracking good sci-fi adventure that doesn\\'t falter until the second half.  the history boys is much less about lighting and composition than it is about bennett\\'s sharp, insightful script.  on balance, i recommend the movie both for nicholson\\'s performance and for the opportunity to spend some time with the kind of man that we often meet in real life, but rarely see on screen.  if you opt to rent the 3-d glasses, men in black 3 will be $14; the product has not, otherwise, changed significantly.  desire and the flush of first love permeate this haunting film, whose italian countryside setting echoes the beauty of the sentiments portrayed.  in a film which features flash floods, it\\'s the love story that becomes the disaster. kedarnath, is indeed a calamity.  a politically charged, love-it-or-hate-it, speculative-fiction fantasy that ruthlessly skewers and satirizes the modern age while also being darkly absurdist and brutally funny.  but this being a [lynne] ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it\\'s grim, far-reaching effects.   whether or not this is the best film marvel studios has made to date-and it is clearly in the discussion-it is by far the most thought-provoking.   wish upon\\'s shoddy humanism just withers the soul and chips away at good taste.  hawking emerges from this as an inspirational man; with such a colossus, finnigan could have afforded to be more questioning.  the movie looks and sounds like a real film, not an extended version of the tv show. the acting and the cinematography is bumped up a notch.  all [director] alexander proves in punisher: war movie is that a martial-arts-trained woman can make a film just as stupid, coarse and numbing as any muscle man.  white noise\\'s scares mostly wind up lost in transmission.  when it\\'s skarsgård, you buy the hangdog. with neeson, he\\'s always just one affront away from killing everybody.   it\\'s like one of ingrid bergman\\'s screwier films, or a john hughes breakfast club-like setup if you\\'re into more contemporary references.  the film is incredibly quotable and full of memorable moments, making for a script that never stops delivering.  this is the conundrum of power rangers: the closer it gets to fantasy spectacle, the less imaginative it becomes.  a slick mishmash of exotica, minutia, and airbrushed platitudes (a lot of babies are born, but how can that be if no one has sex?) that tries to sum up the lives of everybody.  takes a blandly nonpartisan approach to one of the most controversial, as well as influential, politicians in british history.  the matrix revolutions is not a bad movie. it\\'s just a maddening one.  most of submergence feels curiously flat, given the frustration that the characters go through once they are separated.  coasts mainly on surfaces. issues and questions are raised, grazed, but remain unexplored.   worthington is so wooden it\\'s a wonder rubbing up against mendes doesn\\'t cause him to spontaneously combust.   with the exception of bardem\\'s hilarity, fassbender\\'s plumbing the depths of great grief, and pitt and rubén blade\\'s gangster poetics, the word for the film overall is \\'meh.\\'  there\\'s no pay off, no scares, no original plot elements, but a ton of melodrama worthy of a tv movie of the week.  hitman: agent 47 does deliver sleek production values and a stand-out performance from hannah ware... other than that, it\\'s a nonsensical story that feels as if it was written by a 10-year-old who plays too many video games.  its craft is evident, its sincerity is admirable, and it\\'s the kind of movie about which you can say, \"there\\'s not a hair out of place,\" and mean it.  in the age of shopping-centre cinema, christopher nolan builds cathedrals.  step up may sizzle on the dance floor, but when the dancing stops, the film fizzles.  as they navigate the chaos, the film mostly sidesteps genre clichés, managing some genuine emotional resonance amid the inevitable blood and gore.   complementing films from bonnie and clyde to pulp fiction, out of sight delivers original material in a stylish manner.  though the film ... has been described by some critics as \\'almodovar-esque,\\' actor-turned-director baltasar kormakur\\'s sensibility is far less outrageous.  a thoroughly entertaining and fun adventure that delivers exactly what is expected from a movie called \\'clash of the titans,\\' nothing more or less.  \"the great invisible,\" margaret brown\\'s quietly infuriating documentary film about the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill, includes depressing information that many would probably be happier not knowing.  an ungainly hybrid of low-key drama and tawdry thriller, the martha\\'s vineyard-set indie \"off season\" squanders some inviting local color on a blah horror/mystery plot.  cuarón has produced a work that\\'s as reductive as it is offensive.  ... ultimately akin to a never-ending cutscene from a game you\\'re never allowed to play.  characters appear to be working out their thoughts as they speak, rather than reciting something they\\'ve already concluded.  we do see new york from some interestingly different angles and jack goes on a voyage which might inspire others like him.  this biopic serves as a good crash course on the explicit world of gangsta rap.  there\\'s no suave dork or sensitive jock. rather, the high-school kids act like high-school kids -- relentlessly immature and all the better for it.  crossbreed could have aired on the sci-fi channel in 1999 and felt right at home and i mean that in the best possible way.   oldboy is too violent and strange for mass audiences, while the select few who\\'ve seen park\\'s film will recognize lee\\'s work as a beat-for-beat remake that adds almost nothing new while building to the same climax.  a will ferrell cinematic playground. sit back and enjoy.  a welcome diversion from dreamworks animation\\'s increasingly trying shrek series.  there is such a thing as binge pessimism. it happens when one living disaster area, considered insufficient in a story, is served up with several others, causing audience braincells to swirl, stagger and collide against thalamic lampposts.  it\\'s a so-so, unnecessary remake.  it is a bold work that could come only from a strong trust and faith forged over time between the three collaborators.  kidnapping, larceny and murder have seldom been funnier than in fargo.  no, it\\'s not easy to watch, but it\\'s darkly riveting.  in the accountant, blatancy overtakes sincerity...absurdly convoluted, this film stays blatantly politically correct.  the destination is a pageant that will demonstrate, in grotesque, stomach-churning detail, that beauty is skin-deep and that you don\\'t have to win to be a winner.  war. what is it good for? imax 3d movies that wallow in the spectacle of horrific real-life battles, judging by stalingrad.  cheadle isn\\'t always successful, but his efforts work out more often than not. and i\\'d rather see an ambitious film occasionally fall short than a by-the-numbers biography, something this movie avoids at all costs.  [mulloy] brings a documentarian\\'s objective eye to \"una noche,\" yet the actors - non-professionals - convey exactly the emotions she is looking for.  covenant doesn\\'t look to offer much of the same experience first undertaken in scott\\'s \\'79 science fiction-horror, but what we get instead is hardly lacking in brains or guts... and i mean that both figuratively and otherwise.  intersecting the friction of a taut thriller and the biting wit of a dark comedy, cory finley proves he has the eye and the talent.  some movies just don\\'t stand the test of time.  \"dream boat\" includes plenty of buff bodies but milewski has more serious topics in mind, and that is why his wistful doc resonates.   the movie works as a silly parade of ridiculous but fascinating action sequences, but flops as political fiction or coherent melodrama.   the shallow frat-on-frat rivalry and the poor-boy-loves-rich-girl subplot don\\'t mean a thing. but the stepping does got that swing.  i\\'m placing all of the blame on the script and filmmaking, but that\\'s because the actors can only do so much with what they\\'re given.   more of a thoughtful meditation than a narrative feature, this meandering turkish odyssey is packed with profound issues rather than well-defined characters or plot.  exciting, provocative genre cinema.  if devastation porn is your cup of tea, this is the picture for you. that\\'s all it has to offer-just monster-on-monster, building-bashing action like you haven\\'t seen since maybe last week.   whether you\\'re acquainted with the king novel or 90s movie, or new to the it mythology, this new version will leave you breathless - and probably sleepless, too.  on one hand, madame de . . . is all surface and style; on the other, it conveys real loss.  you can expect to see this heartwarming documentary debut on the [netflix] later this year.  under the silver lake never finds a reason for being as weird as it is, making for a confusing and frustrating experience despite its hypnotic visuals and great score.  star wars take heed, there is a disturbance in the force, and it has bad teeth.  [bavo defurne] lacks the mordacity and inventiveness to live up to [the film\\'s] ambitious purpose. [full review in spanish]   surfwise will make you hug your parents a little harder the next time you see them.  while there are shades of neeson\\'s avenging angel in the taken franchise, this is a different, more challenging proposition for the actor.  the fight sequences are slick, but this is a soulless slog.  \\'magic mike\\' might be an exploitation picture, sure, but in the way \\'two-lane blacktop\\' delights car enthusiasts or \\'fat city\\' is for boxing fans.  portrays the ravages of [alzheimer\\'s] with clear-eyed honesty, tracking not only the effects on its victims but also on the caretakers who provide support even as their loved ones are fading away right before their eyes.  conjures a future out of painfully unconvincing special effects.  there is something quite extraordinary about richard linklater\\'s film as it depicts a fictional representation about growing up, family, relationships and life\\'s choices - using real time as its bookmark and calling card.  fans of the novels will eat it up, while newbies may wonder what all the fuss is about.  the nicest thing that you can say about it is that it isn\\'t quite as contemptuous of its audience as the incredibly lazy and unnecessary \"saw v\" was.  \"the conjuring 2\" satisfies more than it disappoints.  there\\'s almost a funny bromance comedy lurking somewhere in \"the change-up\" but it never emerges.   washington\\'s usual irrepressible charm and intelligence are smothered.  a silly and serious work of art that isn\\'t afraid to entertain.  ...condenses the familiarity of so many other party-hearty romps into 93 harried minutes.  bad words is clearly jockeying to be another bad santa, but because it frequently pulls back from going too far, it lacks that picture\\'s killer instinct.  ... it\\'s only a movie -- one the australian tourism commission probably doesn\\'t want you to see.  an uneven, heavy-handed blend of darkly comic satire, drama and magical realism saved by strong performances and an ambiguous ending that leaves enough room for interpretation.   shetty\\'s need to maintain his characters\\' romantic heroism constantly grates against his depictions of their ridiculousness.  it\\'s a silly plot, with even sillier skits sprinkled throughout, but zoolander is great fun.  what a wasted chance at, ahem, a bouncy start of the summer movie season.  cheap laughs, cheap stunts, cheap characters and with absolutely nothing important to say.  ...doesn\\'t have the emotional involvement of the best of sci-fi action films, but it\\'s a thrashing good big dipper ride and the 3d actually works  i would be amazed to hear even the most ardent sparks fan defend it as anything more than rubbish.  i assume cranston\\'s oscar nomination was in recognition of not dying of shame when he\\'s obliged to explain communism to his daughter during a scene lit and staged like an ad for chlamydia medication.  the filmmaker and his work deserve to be better known, and pig is an ideal introduction to both for american audiences.  what follows is a blast of an action movie that still manages to be funny, touching, and has one of the best ending lines of any movie ever. really.  one of the funniest and most quotable films likely to hit cinemas this year.  the film is absent of humor and thrills, and accented with designs and color schemes that are equally notable for their lack of risk.  \\'sinister\\' director scott derrickson again delivers the (modest) goods in this old-school street-cop mystery-thriller in \\'exorcist\\' drag.  eventually, blade loses its edge.  but the music is swell (and swells), and the actors win you over, even if this is no \"les choristes\" (2004).  after years of being playfully assaulted by six, this time he\\'s delivered something that\\'s 100% boring.  taraji p. henson comes out swinging in this female-centric update of the 2000 mel gibson rom-com \\'what women want,\\' but the cliché-ridden film can\\'t go the distance  almost nothing of insight is allowed to intrude on the story, the single point of curiosity being the mild tension between the editor and her flame-haired, forthright creative director grace coddington.  the amount of lens flares in this movie is awe inspiring.  performance is a challenging and thought provoking film, its greatest assets being its four outstanding performances  a dark and thrillingly horrible adventure into the realms of the unthinkable.  though there\\'s nothing actively offensive about the execution of storks, there\\'s simply nothing compelling about it, either.  this is filmmaking at its very best and rarely does a film grip with such intensity, some scenes being almost unbearable to watch as the situations the men find themselves in create palpable tension, which you believe utterly.  ... a push-me-pull-you kind of affair, which somehow chews up almost two and a half hours of screen time in total.  it\\'s one of the weirdest movies i\\'ve ever seen, and not in a particularly good way.  an unintentionally hilarious example of biopic gone wrong.  slender man essentially feels like a movie created from a how-to guide to horror. step one: apply drab color palette with hazy blues, greens, and neutrals. step 2: make sure all set pieces look like generic, creepy locations.  its subjects blandly keep your attention in almost the exact same way that reality-show contestants keep your attention.  it may sound bleak, but there is such life and compassion in every frame that the film\\'s tune turns to a song of love.  there\\'s no doubt polanski is a major artist, and his fans will probably get a lot out of his recollections, but don\\'t expect any rigorous attention to the ethics of documentary-making. this is a personal exercise in public atonement.  a vacuous excuse for a film that\\'s as frustrating as summer blockbusters get.  if you\\'ve ever wished that a really good action director -- john woo, say -- would make a james bond film, you can stop wishing.  . . .demon shares another common horror film problem -- it doesn\\'t satisfactorily resolve the chaos it has indulged.  this really is a movie full of gags. and not entirely in a good way.  a tedious, impenetrable cat-and-mouse game involving russian double and triple agents.  the weakest of the eight best picture oscar nominees, this nevertheless turns out to be one of the better clint eastwood releases of recent vintage, even if it\\'s less a heartfelt piece of moviemaking and more a bald lunge to score yet more academy gold.  no samurai armour; no suicide garden; not much really of fleming\\'s bizarre, obsessive travelogue.  too much explicit sex, drugs and profanity  heartfelt but rather generic.  forster successfully navigates small-town american gothic terrain, brilliantly detailing not only the association between grief and self-destruction, but also grief\\'s capacity to engineer profound redemption.  the family\\'s vulnerabilities and eccentricities burrow under the skin.  it is lifeless, in other words, and quite the slog, with jerky pacing, such an abundance of bearded men you lose track of which bearded man is which, and it reduces two of history\\'s most fascinating women to not much of anything.  [parker and stone\\'s] merciless mockery of hollywood action clichés, particularly those found in jerry bruckheimer\\'s productions, couldn\\'t be more accurate.  a real shocker, it chills the heart.  that director zack snyder\\'s vehemently faithful adaptation of alan moore\\'s seminal graphic novel is as entertaining as it is counts as a monumental achievement. but that doesn\\'t make it a great movie.  a sappily-ever-after fairy tale.  under no circumstances would i recommend that you see \"white irish drinkers.\" but if you do, a good, stiff belt would not be a bad idea.  foster is so good, and the plight of an ordinary person destroyed by violence so compelling, that the movie is likely to be a hit.  why does this movie feel so tentative, so conflicted?  widely imitated but never surpassed.  a genuinely hilarious teen comedy with a fantastic script and wonderful comic performances from its three leads.  it feeds the warrior fantasies of adolescent boys with a testosterone-heavy tale of a war free of moral complications.  ken loach\\'s breezy scribble about lowlife redemption and drunken buffoonery isn\\'t so much heavy-handed as it is charmingly weightless.  eternally heavy-handed director abel ferrara isn\\'t interested in making anything that even remotely resembles a conventional horror film.  uma ótima releitura da série de tevê, o filme traz carell em momento inspiradíssimo.  in its sequel, the jokes, if you can call them that, are trying way too hard.  \"contraband\" involves a lot of energy, but i\\'m getting tired of violent retreads of these heist elements.  this holiday season leave the emotional manipulation to the professionals (read: your family) and avoid \"love the coopers\" at all costs.  there\\'s a terrifying moment in al pacino\\'s new movie.  this movie achieved the unusual - made me laugh out loud - not once, but several times.  it\\'s probably a stretch to surmise that, just as the first film\\'s subtext dealt with health fears, the sequel mines its dread from the horror of malpractice.  simultaneously educates and inspires...  an arresting true story and a ravishing visual creation, but the two remain separate entities that do not support one another but get in each other\\'s way instead.  it sounds the kind of story that should fire the blood and excite great passion but it is workmanlike and too worthy for its own good.  good performances, but it\\'s difficult to give two hoots about close\\'s passion project when the story remains as pinched and hermetic as poor little albert nobbs himself.  with each film in the transformer saga, michael bay makes it clear that all he\\'s interested in are massive metallic special effects bashing into each other and usually exploding.   it\\'s an interesting look at an often glossed-over aspect of the subculture - although the doc sags as it progresses into the mid-1990s and current modes of fashion.  for all the acting excellence on display in nocturnal animals, what mattered more was cracking the narrative rubik\\'s cube invented by wright and elevated by ford\\'s precise integration of style and substance.  not many actors can get away with switching in and out of character, and yet willis does it with ease, confident in our love. and we do love willis.  quale and his crew clearly want this to be a good old-fashioned two-fisted caper, but the pacing is leaden and the plot lacks imagination. worst of all, nobody really bothered to give the picture an angle. it\\'s all straight, flat and dull.  cliché-ridden, stereotype-stuffed and clunky at every inevitably false turn, it\\'s so bad that star hugh grant, usually the most relaxed of actors, actually seems to be in pain throughout the film.  watching due date is kind of like taking a really lengthy car trip. every so often, you see something awesome, but then there are long stretches of monotony in between.   guaranteed non-stop, gung-ho action plugged directly into your synapses.  one for the money is tepidly glib throughout. even violent murders are followed by wisecracks or another prurient opportunity to ogle heigl\\'s behind and cleavage.  it\\'s a sweet, low-key charmer.  [pootie\\'s] nonsense vocab eventually loses the power to impress.  this mirthless eddie murphy vehicle from the director of \\'driving miss daisy\\' is rife with hoary \\'magical negro\\' stereotypes.  it\\'s presumably a labour of love, yet it doesn\\'t give you any sense of a personality or imagination behind the camera.  despite its true-events pedigree, \"kidnapping mr. heineken\" is woefully captive to b-movie crime saga tropes.  the sum of the parts of this film while tantalizing and worth a watch, leave the viewer, like its lead character, lacking closure.  anderson\\'s films often bounce between absurd comedy and poignant catharsis, and mr. fox is no different. its brisk pacing keeps the catharsis from weighing down the comedy.  osmosis jones is one of the most daring and original major hollywood movies in a long time.  alice englert and alden ehrenreich give performances that make this thing worth seeing. given that the story is preposterous, it\\'s entertaining enough to keep you awake most of the time.  a touching story about a mad and sad blocked writer in the midst of a midlife breakdown.  without youtube\\'s david blaine vid there wouldn\\'t be a \\'burt wonderstone\\' ... you don\\'t have to be a houdini to escape this enthusiastically tasteless comedy. just put one foot in front of the other ...  i didn\\'t want either of the two guys to earn her affections. they\\'re both superficial jerks - an opinion that didn\\'t change throughout the entire film.  the characters here exist for the plot, and the plot exists for swooning sensuality, adorable romance, and warm feelings about our shared humanity.  it\\'s light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness, and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing.  it\\'s one of the director\\'s most atmospheric, the shots of a wave-lashed cove and fog-choked headland making the town\\'s impending reckoning almost poetic.  viewers are left with nearly two hours of dull, rather obvious gags.  an infuriatingly-offensive, soft-porn primer on how to treat girls as objects who exist at the disposal of men.  following the lazy formula the director laid down in \"valentine\\'s day\" and \"new year\\'s eve,\" marshall and his writers line up a bunch of stars, set up some basic sitcom situations, then hope audiences are in the right holiday spirit.  mistakenly thinks a lot of profanity, ugliness and bloodshed [...] are, in and of themselves, enough to sustain a satire about showbiz ruthlessness.  the film was crude and the comedy was outlandish more than it was funny.  step up plods along as if feeding coins into a cliché meter.  occasionally preachy and oversimplified, yet captivating, tender and heartfelt. it can lead to many interesting discussions if you open your mind and heart to it, and forgive its preachiness. karen abercrombie gives an emotionally radiant performance.  an odd but not unappealing mixture of mystical road movie and family psychodrama.  art helps man cope with trauma in fact-based drama.   mostly it\\'s a quiet salute to classic romantic comedy - and to a star who, frankly, is far nicer than the times he was born to work in.  a fun feminist spy comedy with wonderfully outlandish events and fascinating examinations of the genre.  bottom line: nice puppetry, crappy movie.  tsangari\\'s deadpan approach to the increasingly sociopathic behaviour of the sextet is perfectly judged.  coppola\\'s graceful, touching, father-daughter chamber piece feels like -- in the best sense -- a love letter to her father.   camp classic grindhouse gore.  the opening sequences of war on everyone are so furiously fast and funny it\\'s nearly unimaginable that mcdonagh can sustain the pace. and yet he does.  despite a hard rocking performance from tom cruise, rock of ages fails to tap into that sex, drugs and sleazy rock \\'n\\' roll spirit of the 1980s with director adam shankman confusing glam with camp.  a film unlike any other this year.  between the thrilling concert footage, what emerges is a pungent time capsule of a forgotten fringe of america, ripe for rediscovery.  teen sitcom-level dialogue, wooden acting, snogging-in-the-rain flashbacks and ludicrously chrome-plated alien racecars.  by no means a perfect film, but carpenter has an unparalleled gift for constructing a sequence.  the pace drags, the stunt double work is obvious and the slapstick, especially a ski-hill scene, is contrived and extended.  yet the crushing disappointment of the film (which matches archive footage with contemporary reflections) is that nothing really happens.   army of shadows is a remarkable and superb film, and american audiences should be rejoicing that is finally (if belatedly) has reached theaters.  it strictly remains more \"trick\" than \"treat.\"  in terms of plotting, birds of passage won\\'t surprise...but you\\'ve never seen this story through this lens before.  the action is so relentless that even hard-core martial-arts fans might need to pause for breath. and much of it is so repetitive that the film occasionally plays like a rerun of itself.  a drama which starts off as a playful comedy only to knock you sideways with its emotional depths.  the lodgers is an almost pornographically gothic movie. if you adore this sort of stuff -- and i most certainly do -- you\\'ll eat every inch of it.  the only truly scary thing about this film is that it runs out of narrative steam with 30 or 40 interminable minutes still to go.  [jack ryan] offers up some formulaic yet fun thrills and is essentially the best you\\'re going to get as far as january flicks go.  this movie is dedicated to a monster that already proved to be inherently frightening, but in spite of a couple of good scares ... it never quite gets to where it [should be].  song of the sea is an impressive feat of animation, made all the more enjoyable by the fact that it\\'s not trying to sell anything.  baumbach is particularly adept at finding the humour in what could\\'ve been tragically sad situations. for all of his characters\\' flaws, baumbach is generous, never playing them for caricatures even though it would\\'ve been all too easy.  the many plot strands the script tries to weave together get so horrifically tangled they choke the humor out of any given situation.  bone tomahawk is a major disappointment.  this is dinosaur stuff. a rubber chicken and a squirting flower would\\'ve really capped things off.  vacillates between laughless humor and cheap social commentary.  the humanity, driven by remarkably honest performances from negga and edgerton, shines through  the movie\\'s not bad enough to be world-ending, merely clumsy enough to make the offending studio exec clean out his desk.  chadwick boseman is so formidable that, were the film itself just a bit better, he would eventually be basking in the same sort of year-end accolades that greeted jamie foxx as ray charles and joaquin phoenix as johnny cash. who knows, he may yet.  could also have lost half an hour yet still maintained the momentum towards a powerful climax...  the result is something that might best be called monty python and the holy mess.  the movie is completely tone deaf - unsure if it\\'s a horror movie, a comedy or a drama - and never finds anything interesting in the characters for the audience to latch on to.  while watching bowling for columbine, the word \\'absurd\\' kept coming to mind.  [deadpool 2] has just the right balance of coarseness and political incorrectness.   all surface, no thought and quite horribly empty.  a bit of a slog when it dismisses dramatic momentum. it\\'s certainly a very handsome creation, but there\\'s little there beyond surface appeal.  the impact of barry levinson\\'s eco-apocalyptic nail-biter is undeniable, especially when you realize some of it is based on fact.  about 20 times less cool than it should be.  a mixed bag of blood, action, and terrible jokes.   polar is an ultraviolent action flick with graphic torture, plenty of nudity and even a fair amount of hard drug use thrown in for good measure. but it\\'s not nearly as fun as all that sounds.  in six words, cradle 2 the grave is hackneyed, preposterous, disposable, undemanding, diverting, and energetic.  an irrepressibly bawdy, sometimes hilarious comedy ...  ms. hanna and her message of empowerment are disappointingly translated very nearly into a cult of personality in this film\\'s idolizing portrayal.  unfortunately, about halfway through, the film takes a (deliberate) nosedive into the depths of human degradation from which it never emerges.  when getting into the nitty-gritty of tapes and tracks, grohl makes a strong case for music docs directed by musicians.  every once in a while cage will team up with a visionary director who knows how to channel that relentless energy into something profound... director panos cosmatos does just that.   the yule log was way more entertaining.  everything it was cracked down to be.  it\\'s passable entertainment that our culture has wildly overrated.  \"gloria bell\" wavers between realistic drama and tender comedy, which makes for an uneven but never uninteresting mix.  delivers a full-bodied, genuinely humorous account of ambiguity and austerity.   it\\'s an accomplished and intriguing work that marks jung out as a talent to watch.  considering its true-life source material, the film\\'s structure mutes its suspense with intermittently compelling flashbacks.  it\\'s a mess of uncertain purpose, jarring tonal shifts, and melodramatic gimmickry.  though malkovich does a nice job in establishing the look and feel of this country, his lack of restraint in trimming the story\\'s excesses is what ultimately turns the film into an overlong bore.  with humor and irreverence, larraín draws his own neruda in this provocative and baroque film. [full review in spanish]  a lazy, by-the-numbers vehicle.  we expect better than this from the scripter of 87 episodes of \"mad men.\"  stylistically strange, sluggish and ultimately unsatisfying domestic drama.  there\\'s a good twist, the young leads are appealing and anyone who enjoys sparks\\' sincere storytelling will enjoy it, even though it\\'s overlong.  nobody does it like brooks! the best interpretation of the tale to date.  speaks powerfully to audiences with its potent blend of extraordinary performances and engaging soundtrack.  what could seem an empty stylistic exercise (and was, in the director\\'s 2002 full frontal) serves to bring a fresh urgency to the tale, ultimately granting the audience a wisdom and perspective the characters never possess.  this is truly a show about a more innocent time. makes you want to believe in magic all over again.  the movie might have resonated more if it threw out some of the grief-counseling cliches and let the idiosyncrasies of the characters dictate more of the drama.  here\\'s a thanksgiving turkey that was rancid as soon as the idea was cooked up.  the informant! says that people who do good or ill have complex motives for their actions, and that not everyone is knowable, instantly or ever.  the skill of the execution is notable throughout; it truly is horribly beautiful. best of all, in this virtual two-hander, its leads pitch their performances impeccably.  people who haven\\'t seen the original will love it, and people who have seen the original should at least like it.  sputore manages to express an age-old existentialist conflict concerning artificial intelligence on the backs of three performances.   high-rise is probably easier to like if you haven\\'t read j.g. ballard\\'s novel: you won\\'t know it\\'s missing 95% of his ideas.  taika waititi has found a way to balance his offbeat sensibility with a maturing humanity.  as a nature doc, more than honey rivals such acclaimed forebears as winged migration and microcosmos, though it\\'s working with a more limited scope, visually-if you\\'ve seen one honeybee, you\\'ve seen \\'em all.  it\\'s not a film i have a lot of affection for and it\\'s not one i\\'m eager to see again, but i appreciate the skill with which the movie was made.  \"mirror mirror\\'\\' is just a limp, jokey family film that wants to have its fairy tale magic and its hip irony, too.  ...sublimely goofy  frenetic, raucous, exhilarating fable about finding your place in a group.  i usually love payne, but his bloated downsizing (all 135 minutes of it) needs trimming all around.   ...a strange and sometimes discomfiting movie that occasionally gets a little heavy-handed as it traces the trajectories of two disrupted souls through the depressingly neutral territory of an airport hotel.   the film, at its core, is about being bullied & standing up to bullies and claiming one\\'s community. some nice sentiments, but so much of it is lost amidst the rampant, third-grade level stabs at humor.(full content review for parents also available)  basically, this is a little over half an hour of good action scenes framed by two hours of narrative nonsense.  if you\\'re looking for a terrific docudrama, you\\'re going to be very, very disappointed. total cookie-cutter and only meryl streep\\'s performance holds it together.  you\\'ll laugh, you\\'ll cry, you\\'ll feel like a kid again, and your kids will become a new generation to know these beloved characters.  it\\'s a brutal, wonderful performance, bolstered by the screenplay, which donoghue adapted herself. clever, nimble, and smart, it gives these actors room to truly work, all of which is supported by abrahamson\\'s sharp direction.  [director] villeneuve never strikes the moral terror that has distinguished his best films. . .blade runner\\'s awesomeness is gone.  faithful to the point of irrelevancy, richard linklater\\'s remake of \"bad news bears\" is an ok enough time passer, but given the talent involved, it should have been much, much better.  bodies and buildings blow up but this is carnage of the most lacklustre sort, with any momentum petering out long before it\\'s \"game over.\"  as well as being a terrific crime drama, all the money in the world also has the questionable distinction of being the first major film to entirely replace one of its stars after post-production.   it\\'s the feel-bad film of the year.  ...simply one of the best pictures of the year.  after watching paranormal activity, you might be inclined to sleep with the lights on for a week or four.  as relentlessly audacious and engrossing as anything within quentin tarantino\\'s flawless body of work...  first-time writer/director lisa nicol\\'s study of australian conductor michelle leonard and her moorambilla voices choir is one of the great documentaries in a year in which the form is curiously absent from cinemas.  the work of ingenious technicians who seem either not to know what gave the original film its magic, or not to care.  the word \\'lovely\\' comes to mind in assessing this intimate, character-driven piece about a man who tries to get away from people but finds to his luck that he cannot.  the issue of abortion will probably always be with us, one way or another, but for this particular battle in that ongoing war \"trapped\" is a powerful weapon.  having assembled a stellar cast (including the late seymour hoffman in his second to last role), slattery does a great job giving them an authentic blue collar neighborhood, but the characters who inhabit it don\\'t always make sense.  one might quibble with the cgi battle sequences ..., but that\\'s a small complaint. as long as [the film] concentrates on the scheming royals in their lush and lavish settings, it soars.  high class briefly gives way to high camp, which then itself dissipates to an anticlimactic thud.  it\\'s all a bit easy - though quite nicely performed - and knightley is never entirely convincing ...  a loosely tied-together string of pleasurable moments and frustrating \"what ifs?\"  taylor lautner tries to hold his own in an action thriller too silly to give him much of a chance.  it is what the classic ghostbusters was: a damn good time at the movies.  they missed the point, but stole the name / the real question today, is who to blame?  the plot and characters of pulpy revenge thriller dead man down are pure b-movie stuff, yet stars colin farrell and noomi rapace lend the film unexpected class and conviction.   little more than a genre exercise that rehashes a wealth of revenge-movie themes and tropes.  compelling and emotionally complex.  despite beautiful cinematography and juliette binoche in the title role, bruno dumont\\'s biopic is a dull fictionalized depiction of three days of the eponymous sculptor\\'s 30-year confinement.  uma ótima releitura da série de tevê, o filme traz carell em momento inspiradíssimo.  the results of the experiment don\\'t quite make all the tedium of construction worthwhile ... the pieces fit together, but the impact is fleeting at best.  pretty persuasion is so exploitative and misogynistic that its last-minute dramatic turns and pleas for tolerance and understanding come off as manipulative as its heroine.  a more entertaining, clever musical than its generic title suggests.   completely engrossing.  director ana lily amirpour\\'s allegorical future-shock cannibal drama is almost a masterpiece, with startling images and ideas.  in a year when women\\'s reproductive freedoms are constantly in the political crosshairs, what to expect when you\\'re expecting feels like just another affront to anyone who owns and operates a uterus.  a minimalist piece to be savoured like a good short story.  young, handsome and about the most amazing pugilist/stunt performer since the days of bruce lee and the pre-hollywoodized jackie chan, jaa electrifies an otherwise lifeless film.  fun ghost story, awesome monster, and jessica chastain dressed as joan jett. what more could you want?   unfortunately, all of the nice attributes in the world can\\'t make up for the script\\'s cynical betrayal of a classic coming-of-age parable.  with an ending so disturbing it just might rival the finale of \"oldboy,\" \"sleep tight\" doesn\\'t let its beauty get in the way of its bite, but it\\'s a film that nonetheless lifts horror to an artform.  robbie is impressive, but allison janney steals the movie as harding\\'s endlessly bitter and bullying mother.  there is so much gusto, such a willingness to go for broke and not look back [in the first act], that it seems too good to be true. as is often the case with such situations, it is.  juliet, naked doesn\\'t have much of value to say about contemporary relationships, at least nothing that hornby hasn\\'t already worked to death, but it\\'s generally good-humored.  a screenplay of cheats and unpleasantries, with director gluck looking to nudity from timberlake to keep the target demographic content, using gratuitous rear end shots to deflect attention away from a rotten motion picture.  jason statham preforms more implausible derring-do as a butt-stomping, daredevil driver for hire.  it\\'s impressive how the likes of winslet, spencer and watts can spout their required gobbledygook and still maintain conviction.  full of long stretches with no dialogue, giving the film a very high nod-off factor.  a former casting director, daniels shows undeniable savoir faire with his actors, a mix of musicians and comedians effectively cast against type.  king\\'s dark tower universe is rich with cultural reference points and is always totally unpredictable, but in cutting it down to consolidate its highlights, the dark tower can\\'t even shoot the most necessary bullets straight.  why this story? as it stands, it\\'s the story of a clean-cut kid who becomes an even nicer clean-cut kid.  although calendar girls is resolutely pleasant, the movie never really goes much beyond that.  the air trickles out of this sensitive but cliché-laced drama ...  frat-boy humor in every sense...a coarse and sloppy gross-out comedy made all the worse by the occasional moments that suggest it could have been something more.  boogie nights weaves a fascinating web of complex characters who are swept up in a tale of excess.  though the film remains entertaining for a little while...the film eventually becomes the same sort of typically dull farrelly brothers comedy most folks lap up willingly.  as with the first two american pie flicks, this is the kind of movie you see again 10 years later and wonder why you liked it back when you were young and dumb.  the lord of the rings. on coruscant. or discworld. cuz that\\'s what [branagh]\\'s done here, with a topping of wormholes and a sweetly old-fashioned side dish of richard donner\\'s superman...  much like as happened with punch drunk love, many audiences will find reason to be disappointed with this film, or at the very least confused. they won\\'t get why there\\'s no big finish, they won\\'t follow the nuances of the script. their bad.  the real story here is p. diddy, who owns this movie. at the end of the second act he explodes as a comic dynamo.  melinda returns woody allen to more steady ground; yet, his film still feels like a work completed with one eye closed.  carrie understands the natural desire of an audience to want to see revenge acted out on bullies, and is content to be what is essentially a superhero origin story.  \\'ever notice how guys are always walking around with their hands in their pockets, saying and expressing nothing? and women are always twirling and letting their emotions get the best of them?\\'  simultaneously offers priceless insight into the nation\\'s past and a worrisome take on the future.  just keeps charging forward, forcing you to stay plugged in and get charged up by what this energizing film has to offer.   forster skillfully captures the tone of a.a. milne\\'s characters and the subsequent productions drawn from the source material, making resistance to the film\\'s charms futile.  out-perversing gus van sant\\'s milk, soderbergh makes a four-hour-plus biopic about a historical figure without providing a glimmer of charm or narrative coherence.  while rise isn\\'t destined to be a new holiday classic...its a mostly well-crafted film with an excellent cast and a dizzying array of visual treats.  the movie is a real thrill ride, even if the plot is full of holes.  this colour saturated world of hokey pocus is truly intoxicating ... [but] i just haven\\'t fallen under the love witch\\'s spell  for all the desperation and tragedy, then, the film offers a kind of heroism, set against a frankly grim but also frequently poetic backdrop.  [writer-director azazel jacobs] clearly has an eye and an ear for the confused rhythms of human life.  a disastrous father-son endeavor about a calamitous father-son expedition, after earth doesn\\'t play to the strengths of any of its major participants.  inspiring docu advocates for legislation to help families.   um dos tipos de besteira mais irritantes que existem: aquele que acredita precisar de duas horas para ser contado.  i don\\'t think maggie gyllenhaal has ever been as radiantly sexy as she is here as a harried mother trying to cope with five kids...']\n"
